<text>
Wilkes County is a [[county]] located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[North Carolina]].  As of 2000, the population was 65,632; in July 2006 the U.S. Census estimated the county&apos;s population at 67,310.  Its [[county seat]] is [[Wilkesboro, North Carolina|Wilkesboro]].

The county was formed in 1777 from parts of [[Surry County, North Carolina|Surry County]] and Washington District (now [[Washington County, Tennessee]]). The first session of the county court was held in John Brown&apos;s house near what is today Brown&apos;s Ford.  The act creating the county became effective on February 15, 1778, and the county celebrates its anniversary as February 15. It was named for the [[England|English]] political radical [[John Wilkes]], who lost his position as [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]] due to his support for the colonists during the American Revolution.

In 1799 the northern and western parts of Wilkes County became [[Ashe County, North Carolina|Ashe County]].  In 1841 parts of Wilkes County and [[Burke County, North Carolina|Burke County]] were combined to form [[Caldwell County, North Carolina|Caldwell County]].  In 1847 another part of Wilkes County was combined with parts of Caldwell County and [[Iredell County, North Carolina|Iredell County]] to become [[Alexander County, North Carolina|Alexander County]].  In 1849 additional parts of Wilkes County and Caldwell County were combined with parts of Ashe County and [[Yancey County, North Carolina|Yancey County]] to form [[Watauga County, North Carolina|Watauga County]].  Numerous boundary adjustments were made thereafter, but none resulted in new counties.

Wilkes County is governed by a group of five elected county commissioners. An elected board of education controls the county&apos;s public school system. Wilkes County is a member of the regional [[High Country Council of Governments]]. The Wilkes Regional Medical Center, founded in 1951 as Wilkes General Hospital, is the largest hospital in North Carolina&apos;s [[High Country]] region. West Park, formerly a large shopping center built in [[North Wilkesboro]] in the 1970s, was transformed into northwest North Carolina&apos;s largest medical park in 2000, complete with offices for physicians, physical therapists, pharmacies, medical specialists, and other medical-related fields.

Wilkes County has two local newspapers: the [[Wilkes Journal-Patriot]] and The Record of Wilkes. Founded in 1906, the Journal-Patriot is published three times per week. The Record is published once per week; it usually focuses on the local arts scene in Wilkes.

Wilkes County is also home to GoWilkes.com, a well-recognized [[internet]] media source that allows residents to discuss current events and local happenings in real time. GoWilkes.com was voted the 2004 Small Business of the Year by the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce.

The county has three radio stations: [[WKBC-FM]], which plays [[adult contemporary]] ([[Hot AC]]) music; [[WKBC (AM)]], which plays American [[country music]]; and [[WWWC (AM)]], which plays [[Southern Gospel Music]]. In 2006, WKBC-FM was voted the best radio station in the [[Charlotte]] listening area by the music critics of Charlotte&apos;s [[Creative Loafing]] magazine.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of 760 [[square mile]]s (1,968 [[km²]]), of which, 757 square miles (1,961 km²) of it is land and 3 square miles (7 km²) of it (0.36%) is water. Wilkes County is located on the eastern slope of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], a part of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] chain. The county&apos;s elevation ranges from 900 feet (275 meters) in the east to over 4,000 feet (1,219 meters) in the west. The Blue Ridge Mountains run from the southwest to the northeast, and dominate the county&apos;s western and northern horizons. Thompkins Knob, the highest point in the county, rises to 4,079 feet (1243 meters). The foothills and valleys of the Blue Ridge form most of the county&apos;s midsection, with some elevations exceeding 2,000 feet (610 meters). [[Stone Mountain State Park]], located in the foothills of northern Wilkes County, is one of the most popular state parks in North Carolina, and is noted for its excellent [[rock climbing]] and [[trout]] fishing. The [[Brushy Mountains (North Carolina)|Brushy Mountains]], an isolated spur of the Blue Ridge, form the county&apos;s southern border. Wilkes County&apos;s terrain gradually becomes more level and less hilly as one moves to the east; the far eastern section of the county lies within the [[Piedmont Triad|Piedmont]] region of North Carolina. The largest river in Wilkes is the [[Yadkin River]], which flows through the central part of the county. The county&apos;s three other major streams, all of which flow into the Yadkin, are the [[Reddies River]], [[Roaring River (North Carolina)|Roaring River]], and Mulberry Creek. Following the devastating floods of 1916 and 1940, the US Army&apos;s Corps of Engineers constructed the [[W. Kerr Scott]] Dam and Reservoir on the Yadkin River four miles west of Wilkesboro. Opened in 1962, the dam created a lake with a shoreline of 55 miles. The lake is used for boating, swimming, fishing, and [[waterskiing]]; it is especially noted for its excellent [[bass fishing]]. The W. Kerr Scott lake is the largest body of water in Wilkes.

Due to its wide range of elevation, Wilkes County&apos;s climate varies considerably. In the winter, it is not unusual for it to be sunny with the temperature in the forties in the county&apos;s eastern section, while at the same time it is snowing or sleeting with the temperature in the low thirties or even twenties in the county&apos;s mountainous south, west, and north. Generally speaking, Wilkes receives ample amounts of precipitation, with frequent [[thunderstorms]] in the spring and summer months; and rain, [[snow]], [[sleet]], and [[freezing rain]] all occur at times during the winter, with the frequency increasing with the altitude. Severe weather is not common in Wilkes but does occur. Tornadoes are extremely rare, but severe thunderstorms can bring strong winds which can down trees and power lines, as well as cause [[hail]]. Wilkes County is far enough inland that [[hurricanes]] rarely cause problems, but a strong hurricane which moves inland quickly enough may cause damage, as with [[Hurricane Hugo]] in 1989. Due to the numerous creeks and streams which run through its valleys, Wilkes is especially prone to devastating [[flash floods]]. The two most memorable floods occurred in 1916 and 1940, killing a number of residents and causing millions of dollars in damages. Since the opening of the W. Kerr Scott Dam in 1962, the Yadkin River has not flooded in the county. Although Wilkes County has never had a severe [[earthquake]], an ancient fault line runs through the [[Brushy Mountains]], and mild earth [[tremors]] are not uncommon. On August 31, 1861 an earthquake estimated at 5.0 on the [[Richter Scale]] hit the southern part of the county and caused minor damage. 

Blue Ridge Parkway]] (part)

Wilkes County is served by a number of highways. However, the only multilane [[expressway]] which goes through the county is [[US 421]]. Other major highways include [[NC 16]], [[NC 18]], [[NC 268]], and [[NC 115]]. The [[Wilkes County Airport]] provides air transport into and out of the county. The [[Blue Ridge Parkway]], America&apos;s most-traveled scenic highway, winds along the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains along the northern and western borders of the county.

Since colonial times Wilkes County has been overwhelmingly [[Protestant]] Christian. The two earliest churches to be established in Wilkes were the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] and [[Presbyterian]]. However, by the 1850s the [[Southern Baptists]] had eclipsed them, and the Baptists have remained the dominant church in Wilkes. The county also contains substantial numbers of [[Methodists]], Presbyterians, Episcopalians, [[Pentecostals]], and [[Church of the Brethren]]. Historically, few [[Roman Catholics]] lived in Wilkes, but recent immigration from other [[U.S. States]] and especially by people of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] descent has increased their numbers. A large Catholic church, built in 1988, is located in [[North Wilkesboro]]. By contrast, relatively few [[Jews]] or members of other non-Christian faiths have settled in the county.

The county is divided into twenty-two [[townships]]: Antioch, Beaver Creek, Boomer, Brushy Mountains, Edwards, Elk Creek, Hays, Jobs Cabin, Lewis Fork, Lovelace, Moravian Falls, Mulberry, New Castle, North Wilkesboro, Rock Creek, Somers, Stanton, Traphill, Union, Walnut Grove, Millers Creek and Wilkesboro.

There are four public [[high schools]] in the county: East Wilkes, [[North Wilkes High School|North Wilkes]], West Wilkes, and [[Wilkes Central High School|Wilkes Central]]. There are also four public [[middle schools]] and thirteen public [[elementary schools]]. The county also has several private schools; most of them are associated with one of the larger [[Protestant]] churches in the county. The only college in Wilkes is [[Wilkes Community College]] (WCC), a public [[two-year college]] within the [[North Carolina Community College System]]. WCC is the home of the popular bluegrass and folk music festival [[MerleFest]].

Wilkes County is part of the [[Yadkin Valley AVA]], an [[American Viticultural Area]].  [[Wine]]s made from [[grape]]s grown Wilkes County may use the [[appellation]] Yadkin Valley on their labels. With the decline of [[tobacco]] farming, some Wilkes County farmers have switched to wine-making, and have hired experts from Europe and California for assistance. As a result, wine-making is growing in popularity in both Wilkes and surrounding counties.

In May of each year, Wilkes county celebrates the new wine industry with the Shine to Wine Festival, held in downtown North Wilkesboro.

[[Jean]] was the theme song of the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning film [[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (film)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]].

Wilkes County was once known as the &quot;[[Moonshine]] Capital of the World&quot;, and was a leading producer of illegal homemade liquor. From the 1920s to the 1950s some young Wilkes County males made their living by delivering moonshine to North Carolina&apos;s larger towns and cities. Wilkes County natives also used bootleg liquor as a means for barter far beyond the borders of North Carolina. Many Wilkes County distillers ran white liquor as far as [[Detroit]], [[New Jersey]] and [[South Florida]]. Since this often involved outrunning local police and federal agents in auto chases, the county became one of the birthplaces of the sport of [[stock-car racing]]. The [[North Wilkesboro Speedway]] was the first [[NASCAR]] (National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing) track; it held its first race on May 18, 1947 and the first NASCAR sanctioned race on October 16, 1949. As noted above, Wilkes County native and resident [[Junior Johnson]] was one of the early superstars of NASCAR, as well as a legendary moonshiner. Johnson was turned into a national celebrity by the writer [[Tom Wolfe]] in a classic 1965 article for [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] magazine. Wolfe&apos;s article was later turned into the 1973 movie [[The Last American Hero]], starring [[Jeff Bridges]] and [[Valerie Perrine]]. [[Benny Parsons]] and [[Jimmy Pardue]] were two other well-known NASCAR drivers from Wilkes. Unfortunately, the North Wilkesboro Speedway was closed following the 1996 NASCAR season after two new owners, Bob Bahre and [[Bruton Smith]], moved North Wilkesboro&apos;s NASCAR races to their tracks in [[Texas Motor Speedway|Texas]] and [[New Hampshire International Speedway|New Hampshire]].  In September 2007 a real-estate developer, Worth Mitchell, announced his intention to buy the North Wilkesboro Speedway and reopen it for auto racing. However Worth Mitchell estimates his odds are 50-50 of pulling off the deal. Speedway Motorsports officials had no comment on the negotiations.

Wilkes County has strong musical roots, and those roots are displayed at the annual Battle of the Bands. Held in downtown North Wilkesboro in September, this rock festival features 20 professional and amateur bands from across the region, performing original music and competing for cash awards and, in some cases, record labels.

It also hosts the annual Shine to Wine Festival, also in downtown North Wilkesboro. Held on the first Saturday of May,  the Shine to Wine festival pays tribute to the county&apos;s heritage of growing from the Moonshine Capital of the World to what is now recognized as a strong viticultural industry.

Wilkes County is also home to the annual [[Brushy Mountain Apple Festival]], which is held in downtown North Wilkesboro the first weekend in October. The festival, which attracts over 160,000 visitors each year, is one of the largest single-day arts and crafts fairs in the Southern United States.

In 1988 legendary folk music guitarist [[Doc Watson]] and singer Bill Young started the [[MerleFest]] music festival in [[Wilkesboro]], the county seat. Held on the campus of Wilkes Community College, and named in honor of Doc&apos;s late son Merle Watson, MerleFest has grown into the largest folk and bluegrass music festival in the United States, drawing over 85,000 music fans each year.

As noted above, another well-known Wilkes native was [[Tom Dula]] (Dooley), a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War who was tried and hanged shortly after the war for the murder of his fiancée, Laura Foster. To this day many people believe that one of Dula&apos;s jealous ex-girlfriends murdered Laura Foster, that Dula was innocent of the crime, and that he accepted blame only to protect his former lover. The case was given nationwide publicity by newspapers such as [[The New York Times]], and thus became a folk legend in the rural South. Dula&apos;s legend was popularized in 1958 by the top-selling [[Kingston Trio]] song &quot;Hang Down Your Head, Tom Dooley.&quot; Dula&apos;s story was also turned into a 1959 movie starring [[Michael Landon]] as Dula, and each summer the Wilkes Playmakers present a popular play based on the story. In 2001, Tom Dula was acquitted of all charges after a petition was sent around Wilkes County and to the county seat.

A curious political fact about Wilkes County is that it is one of the few counties in the Southern United States which has never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate. The county&apos;s strong affiliation with the Republican Party dates from the American Civil War, when most of the county&apos;s residents opposed [[secession]] and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], and viewed the Democratic Party as being the &quot;pro-secession&quot; party. During the Civil War people in neighboring counties often called Wilkes County &quot;The Old United States&quot;, in reference to the county&apos;s pro-Union sentiment. Although the county is heavily Republican, and [[African-Americans]] make up less than 5% of the county&apos;s population, in 2002 the county&apos;s voters elected Luther Parks as a county commissioner. Parks, a Democrat, is the first African-American to hold a county office. He received more votes than any other candidate. In 2006 Parks was re-elected, and again he received the largest number of votes.

Despite its rural character and small population, Wilkes County has been the birthplace of numerous large industries.  [[Lowe&apos;s]], the second-largest chain of home-improvement stores in the nation (after [[Home Depot|The Home Depot]]) was started in Wilkes County in 1946. Until recently Lowe&apos;s had its corporate headquarters in Wilkes County, but the company has since relocated its headquarters in [[Mooresville, North Carolina]], a fast-growing suburb of [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. However, Lowe&apos;s still maintains a large number of corporate offices in the county. Other industries which started in Wilkes County are [[Lowes Foods]] (now headquartered in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]) and The Northwestern Bank, which was once North Carolina&apos;s fourth-largest banking chain until it was merged with the [[Wachovia]] Bank in 1986. The Carolina Mirror Company in [[North Wilkesboro, North Carolina|North Wilkesboro]] was for many years the largest mirror factory in the United States. Although the company no longer exists, the former Carolina Mirror factory continues to produce mirrors through the Gardner Mirror Company. Holly Farms, in Wilkesboro, was the largest poultry producer in the Southeastern United States until it was bought by [[Tyson Foods]] in 1989. Wilkes County remains one of the largest producers of [[poultry]] in the Eastern United States, and many of the county&apos;s farmers are poultry farmers for Tyson Foods. Like many places in North Carolina, Wilkes County has suffered in the last quarter-century from the closing of many of its textile and furniture factories, which have moved to low-wage locations in [[Latin America]] and Asia, especially [[China]] and [[Vietnam]].

As of the [[census]] of 2000, there were 65,632 people, 26,650 households, and 19,321 families residing in the county.  The [[population density]] was 87 people per square mile (33/km²).
