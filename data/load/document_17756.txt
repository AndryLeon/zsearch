The Province of Lower Canada (French: Province du Bas-Canada) was a [[British colonization of the Americas|British colony]] on the lower [[Saint Lawrence River]] and the shores of the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] (1791–1841). It covered the southern portion of the modern-day Province of [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], and the [[Labrador]] region of the modern-day Province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].
 

The Province of Lower Canada was created by the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]] from the partition of the British colony of the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]] (1763–1791) into the Province of Lower Canada and the Province of [[Upper Canada]].

Lower Canada consisted of part of  former [[French colonization of the Americas|French colony]] of [[New France]], populated mainly by French Canadians, which was ceded to Great Britain after that empire&apos;s victory in the [[Seven Years&apos; War]], also called the [[French and Indian Wars]] in the United States. Other parts of New France ceded to Britain became the Colonies of [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and [[Prince Edward Island]].

Like Upper Canada, there was political unrest and a rebellion challenged the [[United Kingdom|British]] rule of the predominantly [[French people|French]] population. After the [[Lower Canada Rebellion|Patriote Rebellion]] was crushed by the British army and [[Loyal (Lower Canada)|Loyal]] volunteers, the 1791 Constitution was suspended on March 27, 1838 and a [[Special Council of Lower Canada|special council]] was appointed to administer the colony.

The provinces of Lower Canada and Upper Canada were combined as the United Province of Canada in 1841, when the [[Act of Union (1840)|The Union Act]] came into force. Their separate legislatures were combined into a single parliament with equal representation for both constituent parts, even if Lower Canada had more population.
