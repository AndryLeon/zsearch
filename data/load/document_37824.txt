The area known as &quot;Norwalk&quot; was first home to the [[Shoshonean]] Native American tribe. They survived primarily on [[honey]], an array of berries, acorns, sage, squirrels, rabbits and birds. Their huts were part of the Sejat Indian village. 

In the late 1760s, Spanish settlers, Padres and missions flourished under Spanish rule with the famous [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] trail traversing the area. [[Rancho Los Nietos|Manuel Nieto]], a Spanish soldier, received a [[Spain|Spanish]] land grant ([[Rancho Los Nietos]]) in 1784 that included Norwalk.

After the [[Mexican-American war]], the Rancho and mining days in the new, American California, ended around the 1860s and the land was subdivided once again and made available for sale now as part of the US State of California. Word of this land development reached the Sproul Brothers in Oregon. They recalled the fertile land and huge sycamore trees they saw during an earlier visit to the Southern California area. In 1869, Atwood Sproul, on behalf of his brother, Gilbert, purchased 463 acres (1.9 km²) of land at $11 an acre ($2700/km²) in an area known as Corazon de los Valles, or &quot;Heart of the Valleys.&quot; 

By 1873, railroads were being built in the area and the Sprouls deeded 23 acres (93,000 m²) stipulating a &quot;passenger stop&quot; clause in the deed. Three days after the Anaheim Branch Railroad crossed the &quot;North-walk&quot; for the first time, Gilbert Sproul surveyed a town site. In 1874, the name was recorded officially as Norwalk.  While a majority of the Norwalk countryside remained undeveloped during the 1880s, the Norwalk Station allowed potential residents the opportunity to visit the &quot;country&quot; from across the nation. 

This pre-1900 era also brought the &quot;first families&quot; to Norwalk, including the Sprouls, the Dewitts, the Settles, the Orrs, and many others.  D.D. Johnston pioneered the first school system in Norwalk in 1880. Johnston was also responsible for the first real industry in town, a cheese factory, by furnishing Tom Lumbard with the money in 1882. Norwalk&apos;s prosperity was evident in the 1890s with the construction of a number of fine homes that were located in the middle of orchards, farms and dairies.  Headstones for these families can be found at Little Lake Cemetery founded in 1843.  The cemetery in on the Norwalk-Santa fe Springs border at 11959 E. Lakeland Rd.

At the turn of the century, Norwalk had become established as the dairy center. Of the 50 local families reported in the 1900 census, most were associated with farming or with the dairy industry. Norwalk was also the home of some of the largest sugar beet farms in all of Southern California during this era.

In February 1958, two military aircraft, a Douglas [[C-118]] A military transport and a U.S. Navy [[P2V]]-5F Neptune patrol bomber, collided over Norwalk at night. 47 servicemen were killed as well as a civilian 23-year-old woman on the ground who was hit by falling debris. A plaque commemorating the disaster erected by the American Legion in 1961 marks the spot of the accident, today a mini-mall at the corner of Firestone Boulevard and Pioneer Boulevard.

Built in 1891 by the D. D. Johnston family, the Hargitt House is an 1891 Victorian Eastlake. The  Hargitt House Museum, located at 12426 Mapledale, was donated to the people of Norwalk by Charles (&quot;Chun&quot;) and Ida Hargitt. The Museum is open on the first and third Saturday of the month from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.
