Major League Soccer (MLS) is a professional [[Association football|soccer]] league based in the [[United States]] and sanctioned by [[United States Soccer Federation|United States Soccer Federation (U.S. Soccer)]]. The league comprises 16 teams, 15 in the U.S. and one in [[Canada]], which is scheduled to become 18 teams by the beginning of the 2011 season. MLS represents the top tier of the [[American soccer pyramid|American]] and [[Canadian soccer pyramid]]s. 

Major League Soccer was founded in 1993 as part of the United States&apos; bid to host the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. The [[1996 Major League Soccer season|first season]] took place in 1996 beginning with 10 teams. Seasons run from late March or early April to November, with teams playing 30 regular season games each. Eight teams compete in the postseason [[MLS Cup Playoffs]] culminating in the championship game, [[MLS Cup]].

The [[2009 Major League Soccer season]] runs from March 19 through November 22. The 15 teams in the league are divided into the [[MLS Eastern Conference|Eastern]] and [[MLS Western Conference|Western]] Conferences — seven in the Eastern Conference, eight in the Western Conference. Each team plays 30 games, evenly divided between home and away matches. Each team competes against every other team twice, home and away, for a total of 28 games. The remaining two games are intra-conference matches, often highlighting geographic and conference rivalries.  The team with the most total points at the end of the regular season is awarded the [[Supporters&apos; Shield]].  Eight teams then proceed to the [[MLS Cup Playoffs]] ending in the single match [[MLS Cup]] final. 

MLS has three automatic berths in the [[CONCACAF Champions League]] with extra berths possible via the [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S. Open Cup]] and the [[Canadian Championship]]. For [[CONCACAF Champions League 2009–10]], qualifying teams include [[MLS Cup 2008]] and Supporters&apos; Shield winner the [[Columbus Crew]], Supporters&apos; Shield runner-up the [[Houston Dynamo]], MLS Cup runner-up the [[Red Bull New York|New York Red Bulls]], [[2008 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|2008 U.S. Open Cup]] winner [[D.C. United]], and [[2009 Canadian Championship]] winner [[Toronto FC]].  Columbus and Houston are automatically seeded into the Group Stage. New York, Toronto, and D.C. are required to play in the Preliminary Round.

MLS also has four berths in [[North American SuperLiga|SuperLiga]], a competition jointly organized by MLS and [[Mexico]]&apos;s national football governing body, the [[Federación Mexicana de Fútbol Asociación|FMF]]. The top four overall teams from the 2008 season, excluding those participating in the Champions League, qualify for [[North American SuperLiga 2009|SuperLiga 2009]].  This includes the [[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]], the [[New England Revolution]], the [[Kansas City Wizards]], and [[Club Deportivo Chivas USA|Chivas USA]].

In 1996, Major League Soccer&apos;s original ten teams, the [[Columbus Crew]], [[D.C. United]], the [[New England Revolution]], the [[New York Red Bulls|NY/NJ MetroStars]], the [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]], the [[Colorado Rapids]], the [[FC Dallas|Dallas Burn]], the [[Kansas City Wizards|Kansas City Wiz]], the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] and the [[San Jose Earthquakes|San Jose Clash]], began play. The early years of the league gave rise to the [[Bruce Arena]]-led dynasty of D.C. United, which won MLS Cups in three of the league&apos;s first four seasons. It took the expansion [[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]] in 1998 to end United&apos;s stranglehold on MLS Cup.  Also joining the league in 1998 was the [[Miami Fusion F.C.|Miami Fusion]].

After its first season, MLS suffered from a decline in attendance. The league&apos;s quality was cast into doubt when the [[United States men&apos;s national soccer team|U.S. men&apos;s national team]], [[1998_FIFA_World_Cup_squads#United_States|made up largely of MLS players]], was eliminated in the first round of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] and finished in last place.

The league began to market itself on the talents of American players, both experienced veterans and fresh talents. Breakout stars like [[DaMarcus Beasley]] and [[Landon Donovan]] began making names for themselves in MLS before breaking into and starring for the U.S. national team, while established players such as [[Brian McBride]], [[Eddie Pope]], and [[Clint Mathis]] continued to prove their value to both their MLS clubs and the U.S. national team.

The league&apos;s ongoing financial problems led to the departure of Commissioner [[Doug Logan]] after the end of the 1998 season. [[Don Garber]], a former [[National Football League|NFL]] International chief, was hired in his place and his leadership became instrumental to shoring up the league&apos;s future. Construction of [[soccer-specific stadiums]] for the league&apos;s teams, largely funded by financiers such as [[Lamar Hunt]] and [[Phil Anschutz]], became a point of emphasis to bring fiscal health and ensure the league&apos;s survival. Hunt&apos;s [[Columbus Crew Stadium]], built in 1999, is often cited as a league model.

On the field, the early wave of international players who had joined MLS at its inception drifted into retirement or moved on to clubs elsewhere in the world. The run-up to the [[2002 World Cup]] saw a gradual shift in the league&apos;s philosophy toward the development of American talent, a move that would eventually lead to success for U.S. soccer.

Despite this movement, declining attendances forced MLS to stop the bleeding by contracting the two Florida franchises, the [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] and the [[Miami Fusion F.C.|Miami Fusion]], just a few years after their establishment.  This left the league with 10 teams, the same number as when the league began.

The 2002 World Cup, in which the [[United States men&apos;s national soccer team|United States]] unexpectedly made the quarterfinals through wins against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], triggered a resurgence in American soccer and MLS. The [[MLS Cup 2002]], held four months after the 2002 World Cup final, set an attendance record as a sellout crowd at [[Gillette Stadium]] saw the Los Angeles Galaxy win their first title.

MLS drew international attention in 2004 with the debut of 14-year-old [[Freddy Adu]] for D.C. United, who entered the league with much fanfare and was heralded as one of the top prospects in American soccer history.

MLS underwent a significant transition in the years leading up to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. After marketing itself on the talents of American players, the league saw some of its homegrown stars depart for more prominent leagues in [[Europe]]. [[Tim Howard]], goalkeeper for the [[Red Bull New York|MetroStars]], was sold to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in one of the most lucrative contract deals in league history. DaMarcus Beasley of the Chicago Fire left for [[PSV Eindhoven]], while Landon Donovan, on loan from [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], was recalled to Germany. Donovan&apos;s stint in Germany was brief; before the start of the [[2005 Major League Soccer season|2005 MLS season]] he was sold back to MLS to play for the Los Angeles Galaxy.

Many more American players, though they factored little in the U.S. national team picture, did make an impact in MLS. In 2005, [[Jason Kreis]] of expansion club [[Real Salt Lake]] became the first player to score at least 100 career MLS goals. In 2005, the now-defunct [[MLS Reserve Division]] was created, with each reserve squad playing 12 games, providing valuable playing time to develop non-starters on team rosters.

It was also in this era that MLS expanded for the first time since the contraction of 2001. [[Real Salt Lake]] and [[Club Deportivo Chivas USA|Chivas USA]] began play in 2005, with Chivas USA becoming the second club in Los Angeles, sharing [[The Home Depot Center]] with the Galaxy. Chivas USA also became the first team in MLS to be directly connected to a foreign club, their sister club of [[Club Deportivo Guadalajara|Guadalajara]]. By 2006 the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] moved to Texas, becoming the [[Houston Dynamo]], after funding for stadium could not be found in San Jose.  The Dynamo became an expansion team, leaving their history behind for a new San Jose ownership group that would materialize years later in 2008.

Since 2007, Major League Soccer&apos;s leadership has taken steps to further internationalize the league in an effort to raise the level of play. Among the first moves in this regard was the [[Designated Player Rule]], which helped MLS bring international stars into the league, despite the relatively meager MLS salary cap, and the creation of the [[North American SuperLiga|SuperLiga]], which places top MLS clubs against top Mexican clubs in an effort to provide more meaningful competition for both leagues. MLS changed the rules regarding foreign players in the league to allow a total of 8. This period also saw expansion reach beyond the United States&apos; borders into Canada, beginning with [[Toronto FC]].

The [[2007 Major League Soccer season|2007 season]] witnessed the MLS debut of [[David Beckham]], whose signing had been seen as a coup for American soccer. Beckham&apos;s contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy was made possible by the Designated Player Rule. Players such as [[Cuauhtémoc Blanco]] of [[Club América]] signed for the Chicago Fire, and [[Juan Pablo Ángel]], who moved from [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] to the [[Red Bull New York|New York Red Bulls]], are some of the first Designated Players who have made major contributions to their clubs.

The departures of [[Clint Dempsey]] and [[Jozy Altidore]], coupled with the return of former U.S. national team stars [[Claudio Reyna]] and [[Brian McBride]] to New York and Chicago, respectively, highlight the exchange of top prospects to Europe for experienced veterans to MLS. Several other well-known foreign players have followed Beckham and Blanco to MLS, including [[Guillermo Barros Schelotto]] to Columbus and [[Fredrik Ljungberg|Freddie Ljungberg]] to Seattle.

By 2008 San Jose had returned to the league, and in 2009 [[Seattle Sounders FC]] became the newest expansion franchise, opening to a crowd of 32,523 at [[Qwest Field]].  Presently MLS plans expansion into [[Philadelphia Union|Philadelphia]], Vancouver, and Portland.

Recently &quot;expansion&quot; and &quot;rebranding&quot; have become buzzwords for the league and its fans. The league has renewed its emphasis on improving the quality of play by its teams via initiatives such as the Designated Player Rule and the creation of a league-wide youth development system.

MLS operates under a single-entity structure in which teams are centrally controlled by the league. In order to keep costs under control, revenues are shared throughout the league, player contracts are negotiated by the league, and ultimately players are contracted not with individual teams but with the league itself. The league fought a bitter legal battle with its players over its economic system, but this was eventually resolved with the players gaining some improved benefits in return for accepting the single entity structure. A court had also ruled that even absent their [[collective bargaining agreement]], players could opt to play in other leagues if they were unsatisfied.

The league&apos;s cost-controlling measures have attracted new ownership that have injected more money into the league, improving it and focusing the league&apos;s resources on fewer clubs. Examples include the [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]]&apos;s sale of the MetroStars to [[Red Bull GmbH|Red Bull]], for an &quot;excess of $100 million,&quot; according to the New York Times. Commissioner Garber said to the Los Angeles Times that, &quot;the sale was part of a plan to have AEG decrease its holdings in MLS. We&apos;re pushing Hunt Sports to do the same thing.&quot;

Commissioner Garber has stated that having multiple clubs owned by a single owner was a necessity in the first 10 years of MLS, but now that the league appears to be on the brink of overall profitability and has significant expansion plans, he wants each club to have a distinct owner. In order to help bring this about, the league is now giving more incentive to be an individual club owner, with all owners now having the rights to a certain number of players they develop through their club&apos;s academy system each year, sharing the profits of Soccer United Marketing, and being able to sell individual club jersey sponsorships.

At one time AEG owned six clubs in MLS, and have since sold the Colorado Rapids, the MetroStars, D.C. United and the Chicago Fire to new owners. AEG&apos;s remaining teams are the Los Angeles Galaxy and the Houston Dynamo. The other major owner-investor in MLS has been [[Lamar Hunt#Major League Soccer|Hunt Sports]], which owns the Columbus Crew and FC Dallas, having sold the Kansas City Wizards to a [[OnGoal|local ownership group]] in 2006. The league now has 16 owners for their 18 clubs (including the 2010 [[Philadelphia Union]] and the 2011 Vancouver and Portland teams).

The 2006-2007 MLS offseason has been considered by some to be the most productive in the history of the league, and there were a number of changes made to the league, which have brought about an increase in the league&apos;s ability to compete financially as well as on the field. The league announced a youth development initiative, The figure is reportedly an &quot;eight-figure deal&quot; that covers the &quot;rights to all MLS games, tournaments and events, including MLS regular season, [[MLS Cup Playoffs]], [[MLS Cup]], and the international competitions [[North American SuperLiga|SuperLiga]], [[InterLiga]], and [[Pan-Pacific Championship]].&quot; However, there are positive signs for profitability in the near future. As soccer-specific stadiums are built, ownership expands and television coverage increases, MLS has managed to see their revenues increase while costs are kept to a minimum. The 2003 season saw the Los Angeles Galaxy make a profit in their first season at [[The Home Depot Center]], However in 2008 there were only three profitable MLS franchises; Los Angeles Galaxy, Toronto FC and FC Dallas .

MLS experimented with deviations from [[Laws of the Game|IFAB rules and standards]] in its early years, some of which had been used in the [[North American Soccer League|NASL]] and continue to be used in [[college soccer]] and many [[National Federation of State High School Associations|high school associations]].

Among them was the use of a countdown clock, rather than a standard progressive clock, with time paused for dead ball situations at a referee&apos;s discretion. Halves ended when the clock reached 0:00, rather than at the whistle of the referee as was customary elsewhere.

Also implemented was the use of shootouts to resolve tie games. These best-of-five contests placed a player 35 yards from goal with five seconds to put the ball past the opposing goalkeeper; if needed the shootout progressed into extra frames. A winning team received one standings point (as opposed to three for the regulation win).

While [[International Football Association Board|IFAB]] rules allow teams to substitute three players during games, MLS allowed a fourth, goalkeeper-only substitute. MLS discarded the rule after 2003 and adopted the IFAB standard, prompted in part by a match in which then MetroStars coach and current U.S. national team manager [[Bob Bradley]] used a loophole to insert an outfield player as a fourth substitute.

MLS eventually conceded that the rules changes, particularly the shootout, had alienated some traditional soccer fans while failing to draw new American sports fans as hoped. The shootout and countdown clock were eliminated after the 1999 season.

MLS continued to experiment with the settling of tie games in regular season play. In 2000, a 10-minute [[golden goal]] period replaced the shootout for tied games. It was abandoned after 2003. The golden-goal overtime remained through 2004 for playoff matches, where it had been used since the league&apos;s inception.

In 2005 the league adopted a playoff extra time structure that followed new IFAB standards for such situations: two full 15-minute periods, followed by penalty kicks if necessary. The [[away goals rule]] is not used in any playoff round.

There are 16 MLS teams divided between the [[MLS Eastern Conference|Eastern]] and [[MLS Western Conference|Western]] Conferences. Each club is allowed 24 players on their full roster.

Before its maiden season and [[1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft|inaugural draft]], MLS [[allocation (MLS)|allocated]] four marquee players across the initial ten teams. These [[1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations|inaugural allocations]] consisted of key U.S. national team and international players such as [[Eric Wynalda]] and [[Hugo Sánchez]]. By the [[1998 Major League Soccer season|1998 season]], the league added its first two [[expansion team]]s: the [[Miami Fusion F.C.|Miami Fusion]] and the [[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]]. The [[2000 Major League Soccer season|2000 season]] saw the league divide into three conferences with teams in either the Eastern, Western, or [[MLS Central Division|Central]] Divisions.

However, following the [[2001 Major League Soccer season|2001 season]], Miami and the [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] were disbanded and MLS returned to ten teams with two conferences. Since the [[2004 Major League Soccer season|2004 season]], the league has expanded with six new clubs: [[Real Salt Lake]] and [[Chivas USA]] in [[2005 Major League Soccer season|2005]], the [[Houston Dynamo]] in [[2006 Major League Soccer season|2006]], and [[Toronto FC]] in [[2007 Major League Soccer season|2007]]. After relocating as an expansion team to Houston in 2006, the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] returned from hiatus in [[2008 Major League Soccer season|2008]]. [[Seattle Sounders FC]] joined MLS for the [[2009 Major League Soccer season|2009 season]].

As of 2009, MLS has had eighteen different clubs over the years, but only eight have won the [[MLS Cup]]. Of the league&apos;s fourteen seasons, only five have seen the [[MLS Supporters&apos; Shield|Supporters&apos; Shield]] winner become league champion.

For the 2010 season, teams are aligned as follows:

MLS will expand to 16 teams in 2010 and 18 teams in 2011. The league has long-term plans to expand to 20 teams, possibly as soon as 2012. The [[Philadelphia Union]] club is in place for 2010 with [[Vancouver MLS 2011|Vancouver]] and [[Portland Timbers (MLS)|Portland]] joining the following season. The Union will play in a 18,500-seat stadium  to be built just west of the [[Commodore Barry Bridge]] in [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Pennsylvania]].

On March 18, 2009 a press conference announced that a new MLS team in Vancouver, Canada will replace [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC|the existing USL-1 club]] in that city, and that it would keep some form of the &quot;Whitecaps&quot; name. Vancouver will join the league in 2011. For at least its first season the Vancouver MLS club will play in BC Place stadium, which by then will have been renovated to include a soccer-specific configuration.  However, the Vancouver ownership group is still hopeful that a new, completely soccer specific stadium will be approved for construction on the waterfront in downtown Vancouver. The franchise announced they would keep the Whitecaps name on November 25, 2009.

On March 20, 2009 a press conference announced that a new MLS team in Portland will replace [[Portland Timbers (USL)|the existing USL-1 club]] in that city, and would keep the [[Portland Timbers]] name. Portland will play in [[PGE Park]], which will be renovated to be a soccer-specific stadium by the time the team joins the league in 2011.

 For more information on MLS team names, see the individual team entries.

Originally, in the style of other U.S. sports, teams were given nicknames at their creation such as the Columbus Crew, the San Jose Clash, or the Tampa Bay Mutiny. Two exceptions to this were D.C. [[United#Sports|United]] and Miami Fusion [[football club|F.C.]], adopting naming conventions usually seen in European clubs. However, new teams such as Real Salt Lake and Toronto FC continued this trend along with the Dallas Burn renaming themselves FC Dallas. Some of the club names have their origins in defunct American professional soccer leagues like the [[North American Soccer League|NASL]], such as the 70s-era [[San Jose Earthquakes (NASL)|San Jose Earthquakes]], [[Seattle Sounders (NASL)|Seattle Sounders]], and [[Portland Timbers (NASL)|Portland Timbers]].

[[Sports club|C.D.]] Chivas USA is the only MLS team whose name does not specify a city, state, or region. The club is named for the Mexican team [[C.D. Guadalajara]], who are often known by their nickname &quot;Chivas,&quot; which translates to &quot;Goats&quot;. The Mexican club, based in [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara, Mexico]], and Chivas USA share the same ownership. Though Real Salt Lake was not originally affiliated with [[Real Madrid]], in 2006 the two clubs signed an agreement to play friendly matches every two years, and to co-sponsor a soccer academy and training facility in Utah. The beverage company [[Red Bull GmbH|Red Bull]] owns the New York Red Bulls as well as [[Red Bull GmbH#Sport ownership|teams in other leagues and sports]].

D.C. United — New York Red Bulls ([[Atlantic Cup]])
