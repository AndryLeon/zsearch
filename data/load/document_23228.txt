<text>The Governor General&apos;s Awards are a collection of [[List of awards presented by the Governor General of Canada|awards presented by]] the [[Governor General of Canada]], marking distinction in a number of academic and artistic fields. The first was conceived in 1937 by [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|John Buchan, Baron Tweedsmuir]], a prolific author of fiction and non-fiction who created the Governor General&apos;s Literary Award. Successive governors general have followed suit, establishing an award for whichever endeavour they personally found important. Only [[Adrienne Clarkson]] created two Governor General Awards the Governor General&apos;s Award in Visual Arts and the Governor General&apos;s Medal in Architecture (though this was effectively a continuation of the Massey Medal, first established in 1950).

Since their creation in 1937, the Governor General&apos;s Literary Awards have become one of [[Canada]]&apos;s most prestigious prizes, awarded in both [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] in seven categories: [[fiction]], [[non-fiction]], [[poetry]], [[drama]], [[children&apos;s literature]] (one each for text and illustration), and [[translation]]. The awards were created by the [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|John Buchan, Baron Tweedsmuir]], himself the author of [[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]. The awards first honoured only two authors each year, and only those who wrote in English. Then, in 1957 the awards were put under the administration of the [[Canada Council|Canada Council for the Arts]] and a cash prize began to be awarded to the winner. By 1980, the council began to announce the finalists for the awards a month before they were presented in order to attract more media attention, and in 2007 the cash prize was increased to $25,000.

During her tenure from 1999 to 2005, [[Adrienne Clarkson]] made an effort to obtain for the Governor General&apos;s study copies of every Governor General&apos;s Literary Awards winning book from fairs and second hand shops. As of 2004 there remained only two titles unrepresented.

 
The Governor General&apos;s Awards in Commemoration of the [[Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General)|Persons Case]] have been presented since their creation by [[Edward Schreyer]] in 1979, and honour the promotion of equality for girls and women in Canada. Five awards are given annually to candidates chosen from across the country, in addition to one award to a Canadian youth. The awards are administered by [[Status of Women Canada]], and may be presented to persons of either gender; [[Ben Barry]] became the first man to win the award when he was presented it in 2008. In addition, two complementary awards are given: The Ramon John Hnatyshyn Award for Voluntarism in the Performing Arts, recognising the voluntary services to the performing arts by an individual or group, and the National Arts Centre Award, which recognises an individual artist&apos;s or company&apos;s work during the past performance year. There is also a mentorship programme that connects award recipients with artists in their early to mid-career.

The Governor General&apos;s Awards in [[Visual|Visual Arts]] and [[New media|Media]] Arts were first presented in 2000. The [[Canada Council for the Arts]] funds and administers the awards.

Six prizes are awarded annually to visual and media artists for distinguished career achievement in fine arts (painting, drawing, photography, print-making and sculpture, including installation and other three-dimensional work), applied arts (architecture and fine crafts), independent film and video, or audio and new media. One prize is awarded annually for outstanding contributions to the visual or media arts in a volunteer or professional capacity. The value of each award is $15,000. An independent peer jury of senior visual and media arts professionals selects the winners.

 
The Governor General&apos;s Medals in [[Architecture]] have been presented since 2002, continuing the tradition of the Massey Medals, begun in 1950.  Up to twelve medals are awarded every two years, with no distinction among the medals awarded.  The [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] administers the competition.
