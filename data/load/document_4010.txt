Edward Osborne Wilson (born June 10, 1929) is an [[United States|American]]  biologist, researcher ([[sociobiology]], [[biodiversity]]), theorist ([[consilience]], [[Biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]]), naturalist ([[conservationist]]) and author. His biological specialty is [[myrmecology]], a branch of [[entomology]].

Wilson is a two-time winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]]. He is known for his career as a scientist, his advocacy for [[environmentalism]], and his [[secular humanist|secular-humanist]] and [[deist]] ideas pertaining to religious and ethical matters. 

As of 2007, he is Pellegrino University Research Professor in Entomology for the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at [[Harvard University]] and a Fellow of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]. He is a Humanist Laureate of the [[International Academy of Humanism]].

Wilson was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. According to his autobiography [[Naturalist (book)|Naturalist]], he grew up mostly around [[Washington, D.C.]] and in the countryside around [[Mobile, Alabama]]. From an early age, he was interested in natural history. His parents, Edward and Inez Wilson, divorced when he was seven. In that same year, he blinded himself in one eye in a fishing accident. The young naturalist grew up in several cities and towns, moving around with his father and his stepmother. His reduced ability to observe mammals and birds led him to concentrate on [[insect]]s. At nine, Wilson undertook his first expeditions at the [[Rock Creek Park]] in Washington, DC. At the age of 18, intent on becoming an [[entomologist]], he began by collecting [[Diptera|flies]], but the shortage of insect pins caused by World War II caused him to switch to [[ant]]s, which could be stored in vials. With the encouragement of [[Marion R. Smith]], a myrmecologist from the [[National Museum of Natural History]] in Washington, Wilson began a survey of all the ants of [[Alabama]]. 

Concerned that he might not be able to afford to go to a university, Wilson attempted to enlist in the United States Army. His plan was to earn U.S. government financial support for his education, but he failed his Army medical examination due to his impaired eyesight. Wilson was able to afford to enroll in the [[University of Alabama]] after all. There, he earned his B.S. and M.S. degrees. He later earned his Ph.D. degree from [[Harvard University]].

In 1994 Island Press published &quot;Naturalist&quot; an autobiography of Wilson&apos;s life .

&quot;The [[Epic of evolution|evolutionary epic]],&quot; Wilson wrote in his book on human nature, &quot;is probably the best myth we will ever have.&quot; Myth as falsehood was not the usage intended by Wilson in this statement. Rather, myth as a grand narrative that provides a people with a placement in time — a meaningful placement that celebrates extraordinary moments of a shared heritage. Wilson was not the first to use the term, but his fame prompted its usage as the morphed phrase epic of evolution.
Sociobiology is defined (by Wilson) as the systematic study of the biological basis of all forms of behavior, including human, incorporating ecology, ethology, and genetics. &quot;If humankind evolved by Darwinian natural selection, genetic chance and environmental necessity, not God, made the species.&quot; &quot;The brain [and the mind] exists because it promotes the survival and multiplication of the genes that direct its assembly.&quot; The two apparent dilemmas we face therefore are: (1) We lack any goal external to our biological nature (for even religions evolve to enhance the persistence and influence of their practitioners). Will societies transcendental goals dissolve and will we regress to mere self-indulgence? (2) Morality evolved as instinct &quot;which of the censors and motivators should be obeyed and which ones might better be curtailed or sublimated.&quot;

Although much human diversity in behavior is culturally influenced, some has been shown to be genetic - rapid acquisition of language, human unpredictability, hypertrophy (extreme growth of pre-existing social structures), altruism and religions. &quot;Religious practices that consistently enhance survival and procreation of the practitioners will propagate the physiological controls that favor the acquisition of the practices during single lifetimes.&quot; Unthinking submission to the communal will promotes the fitness of the members of the tribe. Even submission to secular religions and cults involve willing subordination of the individual to the group. Religious practices confer biological advantages 

Wilson used sociobiology and evolutionary principles to explain the behavior of the social insects and then to understand the social behavior of other animals, including humans, thus  established sociobiology as a new scientific field. He argued that all animal behavior, including that of humans, is the product of [[heredity]], environmental stimuli, and past experiences, and that [[free will]] is an illusion. He has referred to the biological basis of behaviour as the &quot;genetic leash.&quot; The sociobiological view is that all animal social behavior is governed by [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] rules worked out by the laws of [[evolution]]. This theory and research proved to be seminal, controversial, and influential. 

The controversy of sociobiological research is in how it applies to humans. The theory established a scientific argument for rejecting the common doctrine of [[tabula rasa]], which holds that human beings are born without any innate mental content and that culture functions to increase human knowledge and aid in survival and success. In the final chapter of the book Sociobiology and in the full text of his [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[On Human Nature]], Wilson argues that the human mind is shaped as much by genetic inheritance as it is by culture (if not more). There are limits on just how much influence social and environmental factors can have in altering human behavior.

Wilson, along with [[Bert Hölldobler]], has done a systematic study of ants and ant behavior, culminating in their encyclopedic work, [[The Ants]] (1990). Because much self-sacrificing behavior on the part of individual ants can be explained on the basis of their genetic interests in the survival of the sisters, with whom (it was thought at the time) they share 75% of their genes, Wilson was led to argue for a sociobiological explanation for all social behavior on the model of the behavior of the social insects. (It turns out that because queens mate more than once, the 75% number is too high, though suggestive for selfish-gene explanations.) In his more recent work, he has sought to defend his views against the criticism of younger scientists such as [[Deborah Gordon]], whose results challenge the idea that ant behavior is as rigidly-predictable as Wilson&apos;s explanations make it.

Edward O. Wilson, referring to [[ant]]s, once said that &quot;[[Karl Marx]] was right, [[socialism]] works, it is just that he had the wrong species&quot;, meaning that while ants and other [[eusocial]] species appear to live in [[communist]]-like societies, they only do so because they are forced to do so from their basic biology, as they lack reproductive independence: worker ants, being sterile, need their ant-queen to survive as a colony and a species and individual ants cannot reproduce without a queen, thus being forced to live in centralised societies.  Humans, however, do possess reproductive independence so they can give birth to offspring without the need of a &quot;queen&quot;, and in fact humans enjoy their maximum level of Darwinian fitness only when they look after themselves and their families, while finding innovative ways to use the societies they live in for their own benefit.

In his 1998 book [[Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]], Wilson discusses methods that have been used to unite the sciences, and might be able to unite the sciences with the humanities. Wilson prefers and uses the term &quot;[[consilience]]&quot; to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different specialized fields of human endeavor. He defines [[human nature]] as a collection of [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] rules, the genetic patterns of mental development. He argues that culture and rituals are products, not parts, of human nature. He says [[art]] is not part of human nature, but our appreciation of art is. He argues that concepts such as art appreciation, fear of snakes, or the [[incest]] [[taboo]] ([[Westermarck effect]]) can be studied using scientific methods. Previously, these phenomena were only part of [[Psychology|psychological]], [[Sociology|sociological]], or [[Anthropology|anthropological]] studies. Wilson proposes that they can be part of interdisciplinary research.

Wilson has argued that the &quot;[[Unit of selection|unit]] of selection is a gene, the basic element of heredity. The target of selection is normally the individual who carries an ensemble of genes of certain kinds.&quot; With regards to the use [[kin selection]] in explaining the behavior of [[Eusociality|eusocial]] [[insects]], Wilson said to [[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] magazine, the &quot;new view that I&apos;m proposing is that it was [[group selection]] all along, an idea first roughly formulated by Darwin.&quot;

As summarized by Michael McGoodwin  such as [[Richard Lewontin]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]], who were strongly opposed to his ideas regarding sociobiology. [[Marshall Sahlins]]&apos;s work The Use and Abuse of Biology was a direct criticism of Wilson&apos;s theories.

Politically, Wilson&apos;s sociobiological ideas have offended some [[Liberalism|liberals]] and [[Conservativism|conservatives]] who favored the idea that human behavior was culturally based. Sociobiology re-ignited the [[nature versus nurture|nature-versus-nurture]] debate, and Wilson&apos;s scientific perspective on human nature led to public debate. He was accused of [[racism]], [[misogyny]], and [[eugenics]]. In one incident, a female member of the [[International Committee Against Racism]] poured a pitcher of water on Wilson&apos;s head and chanted &quot;Wilson, you&apos;re all wet&quot; at a [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] conference in November 1978. Wilson later spoke of the incident as a source of pride: &quot;I believe...I was the only scientist in modern times to be physically attacked for an idea.&quot;

Religious objections included those of Paul E. Rothrock, who said: &quot;... sociobiology has the potential of becoming a religion of scientific materialism.&quot;
