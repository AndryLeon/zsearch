Men at Work were an [[Australia]]n [[reggae]]-influenced [[rock music|rock]] band which achieved international success in the 1980s. They are the only Australian artists to have a #1 album and single simultaneously in the [[United States]] (with [[Business as Usual (Men at Work album)|Business as Usual]] and &quot;[[Down Under (song)|Down Under]]&quot; respectively). At the same time, they also had a simultaneous #1 single and album in the [[United Kingdom]]. The group won the [[Grammy Awards of 1983|1983 Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] and sold over 30 million albums worldwide. The band&apos;s sound is distinguished by its use of [[woodwind]] and [[Brass instrument|brass]] instruments. 

[[Colin Hay]] emigrated to Australia in 1967 from [[Scotland]] with his family. In 1978, he formed a duo with [[Ron Strykert]], which expanded with the addition of drummer [[Jerry Speiser]] and Australian [[progressive rock]] keyboard player Greg Sneddon. They formed an unnamed four-piece group that would later morph into Men at Work. The band&apos;s first experience in the recording studio was recording the music to Riff Raff, a low-budget stage musical Sneddon had worked on. Sneddon soon left, to be replaced in late 1979 by saxophonist/flautist/keyboardist [[Greg Ham]].

By late 1979, the group took up residence at the Cricketer&apos;s Arms pub.  Desperate for a name, they took the &quot;Men at Work&quot; moniker from a street sign denoting construction.  Shortly thereafter, the band, who had been performing with Strykert on [[bass guitar]], recruited bassist [[John Rees (musician)|John Rees]] and the group was complete.

The group played a regular residency at [[Melbourne]]&apos;s Cricketers Arms Hotel and built a strong local following. In 1980, they financed a single (&quot;Keypunch Operator&quot;) backed by an early version of [[Down Under (song)|&quot;Down Under&quot;]].

In 1981, [[Columbia Records]] signed Men at Work. Their first single, &quot;[[Who Can It Be Now?]]&quot;, reached #1 on the Australian chart in August 1981. A subsequent single (a re-worked version of &quot;[[Down Under (song)|Down Under]]&quot;) and their first album ([[Business as Usual (Men at Work album)|Business as Usual]]) also went to #1. The album also debuted at #1 in [[New Zealand]].

Despite its strong Australian showing, and having an American producer (Peter McIan), [[Business as Usual (Men at Work album)|Business as Usual]] was twice rejected by Columbia&apos;s parent company in the United States. Thanks to the persistence of the band&apos;s management, the album was eventually released in the USA and the UK six months after its Australian release. Men at Work toured the USA to promote the album, supporting [[Fleetwood Mac]].

In October 1982, &quot;[[Who Can It Be Now?]]&quot; hit #1 in the USA. Then, in November of that year, Business As Usual began a 12 week run at #1 on the US album chart. While &quot;Who Can It Be Now?&quot; was still in the top ten, the second single, &quot;Down Under&quot; was released. It entered the charts at #79; ten weeks later, it was #1. By January 1983, Men at Work had the top album and single in both the USA and the UK - a feat never achieved previously by an Australian act.

Men at Work won a [[Grammy Award]], winning Best New Artist for 1983 ahead of [[Asia (band)|Asia]], [[Jennifer Holliday]], [[The Human League]] and [[Stray Cats]]. This was the first for an Australian recording act.

That same year, Canada awarded them a [[Juno Award]] for &quot;International LP of the Year.&quot;

The band soon released their second album [[Cargo (album)|Cargo]]. It had been finished in the summer of 1982, but held for release due to the phenomenal success of the band&apos;s debut. The new album went to #1. The international market, where Business As Usual was still riding high, kept the album at #3 on the [[Billboard 200]] album chart. The album produced three chart singles in the USA: &quot;[[Overkill (Men at Work song)|Overkill]]&quot; [#3], &quot;[[It&apos;s a Mistake]]&quot; [#6], and &quot;[[Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive]]&quot; [#28]. The band toured the world extensively in 1983.

In 1984, the band took a long break as members pursued other interests and recovered from the two years of constant touring they&apos;d done in support of both albums. At the end of that period, Jerry Speiser and John Rees were advised by management that they were no longer members of the band. The remaining members (Hay, Ham and Strykert) recorded a third album [[Two Hearts (album)|Two Hearts]] which peaked at #50 on the chart. Although four songs were released as singles to promote the album (lead single &quot;[[Everything I Need]]&quot;, &quot;Man With Two Hearts&quot;, &quot;Maria&quot;, and &quot;Hard Luck Story&quot;), only the first song charted in the U.S., and that only at #47. The record relied heavily on drum programming and [[synthesizers]] and reduced the presence of Ham&apos;s saxophone, giving it a different feel than the band&apos;s first two records.

Strykert left the group during the album&apos;s production .  Hay and Ham hired new bandmates to tour behind the record, including [[jazz]]/[[fusion music|fusion]] bassist Jeremy Alsop, [[progressive rock]] drummer Mark Kennedy, and guitarist James Black, who respectively play on seven, eight and one of the ten tracks on Two Hearts. Soon after, third guitarist Colin Bayley was added to the band&apos;s touring lineup, and Kennedy was replaced by prodigious young drummer [[Chad Wackerman]]. Australian singers [[Kate Ceberano]] and [[Renee Geyer]] also worked and performed live with the group during this period as guests.

Men at Work performed three songs for the [[1985 in music|1985]] [[Oz for Africa]] concert (part of the global [[Live Aid]] program) - &quot;Maria&quot;, &quot;[[Overkill (Men at Work song)|Overkill]]&quot;, and an unreleased song called &quot;The Longest Night&quot;. It was broadcast in Australia (on both [[Seven Network]] and [[Nine Network]]) and on [[MTV]] in the US. &quot;Maria&quot; and &quot;[[Overkill (Men at Work song)|Overkill]]&quot; were also broadcast by [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) during their Live Aid telecast.

Ham left during the band&apos;s time touring behind the album.

Hay maintains a successful [[Colin Hay|solo career]] and plays with [[Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band]]. Strykert lives in [[Los Angeles]], continues to play music and released his first solo album titled Paradise in September 2009. He has expressed some resentment towards Hay, mainly over royalties. Ham has remained musically active and currently plays sax with the Melbourne-based group The Nudist Funk Orchestra. Rees is now a music teacher in Melbourne.
