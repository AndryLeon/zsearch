Verulamium was an ancient town in [[Roman Britain]]. It was sited in the southwest of the modern city of [[St Albans]] in [[Hertfordshire]], [[Great Britain]].  A large portion of the Roman city remains unexcavated, being now park and agricultural land, though much has been built upon (see below).  The ancient [[Watling Street]] passed through the city.

Before the Romans, it was known as Verulamion (perhaps meaning &quot;[settlement of] Uerulamos [Broad-Hand]&quot; in Brittonic) the capital of the [[Catuvellauni]] tribe. The settlement was established by their leader [[Tasciovanus]]. In this pre-Roman form, it was among the first places in [[Great Britain|Britain]] recorded by name.

The Roman settlement was granted the rank of municipium in c. [[AD 50]], meaning its citizens had all the rights of a citizen of Rome. It grew to a significant town, and as such received the attentions of [[Boudica]] of the [[Iceni]] in AD 61, when Verulamium was sacked and burnt: the black ash layer has been recorded by archaeologists, thus confirming the Roman written record. It grew steadily: by the early 3rd century it covered an area of about , behind a deep ditch and wall.  It is the location of the marytrdom of the first English martyr saint, St Alban, who was a Roman patrician converted by the priest Amphibalus.  This story is recorded by the monks of the abbey of the town, notably Brother [[Matthew Paris]] in his Anglo-Norman Vie de Seint Auban.

Verulamium had a [[forum (Roman)|forum]], [[basilica]] and a [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]], much of which were damaged during two fires, one in AD 155 and the other around AD 250. One of the few extant Roman inscriptions in Britain is found on the remnants of the forum; see [[Verulamium Forum inscription]]. The town was rebuilt in [[Rock (geology)|stone]] rather than [[timber]] at least twice over the next 150 years. Occupation by the Romans ended between 400 and 450.

There are a few remains of the Roman city visible, such as parts of the [[city walls]], a [[hypocaust]] still [[in situ]] under a mosaic floor and a theatre, which is on land belonging to the Earl of Verulam - as well as items in the Museum (below). More remains under the agricultural land nearby which had never been excavated were for a while seriously threatened by deep [[ploughing]]. 

The city was quarried for building material when medieval St Albans was founded; indeed, much of [[St Albans Abbey|Norman abbey]] was constructed from the remains of the Roman city, with Roman brick and stone visible. The modern city takes its name from [[Saint Alban|Alban]], a citizen of Verulamium, or Roman soldier, who was condemned to death in the 3rd century for sheltering a [[Christian]]. Alban was converted by him to Christianity, and by his death became the first British Christian [[martyr]].

There is a sizeable museum run by the town council in [[Verulamium Park]] (adjacent to [[St. Michael&apos;s Church, St. Albans|St Michael&apos;s Church]]) which contains much information about the town, both as a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Iron Age]] settlement, plus Roman history in general. The museum was established following the excavations carried out by Mortimer Wheeler and his wife Tess Wheeler. It is noted for the large and colourful mosaics, and many other artefacts such as [[pottery]], jewellery, tools and [[coin]]s from the Roman period. Many were found in formal excavations but some, particularly a [[coffin]] still containing a male skeleton, were unearthed nearby during building work. It is considered one of the best museums of Roman history in the country and has won an architectural award for its striking domed entrance. 

Since much of the modern city and its environs is built over Roman remains, it is still not uncommon to unearth Roman artefacts several miles away. A complete tile [[kiln]] was found in Park Street some six miles from Verulamium in the 1970s, and there is a Roman mausoleum in [[Rothamsted Park]] five miles away.

Within the walls of Verulam, which he took for the name of his Barony, Sir [[Francis Bacon]], the essayist and statesman, built a refined small house that was thoroughly described by the 17th century diarist [[John Aubrey]]; no trace of it is left, but Aubrey noted &quot;At Verulam is to be seen, in some few places, some remains of the wall of this Citie&quot; (see the illustration).

The [[asteroid]] [[4206 Verulamium]] was named in honour of the ancient city.
