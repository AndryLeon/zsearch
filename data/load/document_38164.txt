Redlands () is a city in [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], [[California]], [[United States]].  As of the 2000 census, the city had a total population of 63,591. The city is located 10 miles east of [[Downtown San Bernardino|downtown]] [[San Bernardino]].

The area now occupied by Redlands was originally part of the territory of the Morongo and Aguas Calientes tribes of [[Cahuilla]] people. Explorations such as those of [[Pedro Fages]] and [[Francisco Garcés]] sought to extend Catholic influence to the indigenous people and the dominion of the Spanish crown into the area in the 1770s. The [[Serrano Indians|Serrano]] (Mountain-dwelling Cahuilla) village of Guachama, located just to the west of present-day Redlands, was visited by Fr. [[Francisco Dumetz]] in 1810, and was the reason the site was chosen for a mission outpost. Dumetz reached the village on May 20, the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of [[Saint Bernardino of Siena]], and thus named the region the [[San Bernardino Valley]]. The Franciscan friars from San Gabriel established the [[San Bernardino Asistencia]] in 1819 and embarked on the usual program of training the native tribes to raise crops and encouraging permanent settlements. By 1820, a ditch, known as a zanja, was dug by the natives for the friars from Mill Creek to the Asistencia. In 1822, word of the Mexican triumph in the [[Mexican War of Independence|War of Independence]] reached the inland area, and lands previously claimed by Spain passed to the custody of the [[Mexican government]].

In 1842, the [[José del Carmen Lugo#Antonio Maria Lugo|Lugo]] family received a grant to a large tract in the area and this became the first fixed settler civilization. The area northwest of current Redlands, astride the [[Santa Ana River]], would become known as Lugonia. In 1851, the area received its first Anglo inhabitants in the form of several hundred [[Mormon]] pioneers, who purchased the entire Rancho San Bernardino, founded nearby [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], and established a prosperous farming community watered by the many lakes and streams of the [[San Bernardino Mountains]]. The Mormon community left wholesale in 1857, recalled to [[Utah]] by [[Brigham Young]] during the tensions with the federal government that ultimately led to the brief [[Utah War]]. Benjamin Barton purchased  from the Latter-day Saints and planted extensive vineyards and built a winery.

&quot;The first settler on the site of the present Redlands is recorded to have erected a hut at the corner of what is now Cajon St. and Cypress Ave.; he was a sheep herder, and the year, 1865,&quot; reported Ira L. Swett in &quot;Tractions of the Orange Empire.&quot; Lugonia attracted settlers; in 1869, Barry Roberts, followed a year later by the Craw and Glover families. &quot;The first school teacher in Lugonia, George W. Beattie, arrived in 1874—shortly followed by the town&apos;s first negro settler, Israel Beal.&quot; 

In the 1880s, the arrival of the [[Southern Pacific]] and [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe]] [[Railroad]]s, connecting [[Southern California]] to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake]] touched off a land boom, with land speculators such as [[John W. North]] flooding into the area now known as the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]].  North and others saw the area, with its hot, dry climate and ready access to water supplies, as an ideal center for [[citrus]] production.  The city of Redlands was soon established by [[Frank E. Brown]], a civil engineer, and [[E. G. Judson]], a New York stock broker, to provide a center (along with North&apos;s nearby settlement at [[Riverside, California|Riverside]]) for the burgeoning citrus industry. They named their city “Redlands” after the color of the adobe soil. So large had the area grown by [[1888]] that it was decided to incorporate. &quot;A red-letter day in the Annals of Redlands,&quot; pronounced Scipio Craig, editor of the [[The Citrograph]] newspaper, of the [[November 26]] incorporation. The original community of Lugonia was absorbed at this time.

The [[Redlands Street Railway Company]] was incorporated on March 22, 1888, acquiring on June 5 a franchise from the San Bernardino County Supervisors dating to December 1887, conveying the right to construct, operate and maintain for a term of 50 years a line of street railways in Redlands, Terracina and vicinity.  The initial operations began in June 1889 with a single-track line operating two-mule-team cars, the first street railway company of several to provide service to the growing community. Electrification and new rails replaced the mules in 1899.   Most Redlands street railways would pass to the [[San Bernardino Valley Traction Company]] in a consolidation on June 3, 1903 , and thence to the [[Pacific Electric]] on February 8, 1911.  [[Collis P. Huntington]] of the [[Southern Pacific]] gained control of the four-mile-long streetcar line of the [[Redlands Central Railway Company]] in 1908. 

The arrival of the [[Pacific Electric Railroad]] interurban railway of [[Los Angeles]], in the early 20th century, provided a convenient, speedy connection to the fast-growing city and its new port at [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]], bringing even greater prosperity to the town and a new role as a vacation destination for wealthy Angelenos. Redlands, was, in fact, the eastern-most point of the &quot;Big Red Car&quot; system. At its peak, the PE operated five individual local routes in Redlands, with trolleys running up to Smiley Heights, and on Orange, Olive, and Citrus Avenues.  Pacific Electric interurban service to Redlands was finally abandoned on July 20, 1936, although PE, and later [[Southern Pacific]], which absorbed the Big Red Car system, provided freight service as far as the Sunkist packing plant on San Bernardino Avenue into at least the 1970s. The abandoned Pacific Electric La Quinta trestle over the [[Santa Ana River]] still stands today, immediately south of [[San Bernardino International Airport]].

At the turn of the 1900s, Redlands was the &quot;Palm Springs&quot; of the next century, with roses being planted along many city thoroughfares. Some of these plantings would survive as wild thickets into the 1970s, especially adjacent to orange groves where property management was lax. Washingtonian palms were planted along many main avenues. In fact, Redlands was the first city to have center medians with trees or gardens in between roads. So beautifully kept was the area, with the dramatic mountain backdrops, that for several years the Santa Fe Railroad operated excursion trains along the loop that passed through the orange groves of Redlands and [[Mentone, California|Mentone]], across the [[Santa Ana River]], and back into [[San Bernardino]] via East Highlands, Highlands and [[Patton, California|Patton]], and advertised as the &quot;Kite Route&quot; due to its multi-sided alignment. The trestle over &quot;the Wash&quot; north of Mentone was carried away during a flood in 1938 and never replaced, the line being truncated there. The Southern Pacific branch line from the [[San Timoteo Canyon]] to [[Crafton]] was abandoned after the packing house business died. A thru-truss bridge over the Zanja (locally pronounced &quot;Zank-ee&quot;) exists today, abandoned in place. [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe]], result of the [[AT&amp;SF]]-[[Burlington Northern]] merger, applied to abandon its San Bernardino-connected branch line east of downtown Redlands in 2007. A move was made by transit activists to have this branch revitalized as part of the Southern California transit districts, but it came to nothing.

The city has been visited by three [[President of the United States|Presidents]], [[William McKinley|President McKinley]] was the first in 1901, followed by [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Teddy Roosevelt]] in 1903 and [[William H. Taft|President William H. Taft]]. Local landmarks include the [[A.K. Smiley Public Library]], a Moorish-style library built in 1898, and the [[Redlands Bowl]], built in 1930 and home of the oldest continuously free outdoor concert series in the United States. Located behind the Smiley Library is the [[Lincoln Shrine]], the only memorial honoring the &quot;Great Emancipator&quot;, the sixteenth president, west of the [[Mississippi River]]. Other famous homes include “America’s Favorite Victorian,” the Morey Mansion, on Terracina Boulevard, and the [[Kimberly Crest House and Gardens]], a home museum featured on the PBS series “America’s Castles.” Named after the family that purchased the house, the owners of [[Kimberly-Clark]] (makers of paper goods and [[Kleenex]]), it is a beautiful mansion set high on a hill overlooking the whole valley. Redlands is still regarded as the &quot;Jewel of the Inland Empire.&quot;

Coming west from [[Los Angeles]] and heading east toward [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], [[Interstate 10 in California|Interstate 10]] bisects Redlands in two, right through the middle. A tempestuous political battle occurred in the 1950s when three routes for the new freeway were considered, one north of town through the Lugonia district, the center route through the city, and a southern alignment through [[San Timoteo Canyon]], parallelling the  [[Southern Pacific]] railroad tracks. The central route was finalized in 1957 and Redlands Mayor Charles Parker cut the ceremonial ribbon to open the new interstate on [[August 28]], [[1962]].  
The new [[State Route 210 (California)|State Route 210]] or Foothill Freeway ends at Interstate 10 in Redlands, then heads west toward [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and [[Los Angeles]].

Kimberly Crest (Redlands, CA)|Kimberly Crest House and Gardens]], built in 1897 this [[Châteauesque|French château-style]] home is preserved by the Kimberly-Shirk Association that was formed for that purpose.  This three-story chateau is over  and was originally built for Mrs. Cornelia A. Hill.  In 1905 [[J. Alfred Kimberly]] (co-founder of [[Kimberly-Clark]]) purchased this home for his family.  His daughter, Mary Kimberly Shirk, lived in the home until her death in 1979.  Before she passed the majority of the grounds were sold to the City of Redlands to become a botanical park, now known as Prospect Park.  After her death, the home was left to &quot;the people of Redlands&quot; and the monies from the sale of the park were used to create the Kimberly-Shirk Association that cares for the home and provides tours within.

Edwards Mansion]], built in 1890 by one of the founders of Redlands, Citrus grower James S. Edwards, this structure was originally used not as a family home but as a boarding house.  Mr. Edwards used standard plans and built the house on a small rise on Cajon St. from where the young orange groves he planted could be seen in every direction.  Eventually the Edwards family moved into the structure and occupied it continually until 1958 when Mrs. Edwards died.  Almost a decade later, Plymouth Village acquired the home and used it for their business offices until it was acquired by the Edwards Mansion complex in 1973 for the large sum of one dollar.  The structure was moved to its current location off of the 10 freeway and restored to serve its current purpose as a popular wedding location.  

Morey Mansion]], built in 1890 with the proceeds from the sale of Sarah Morey&apos;s citrus nursery there is no known architect to this beautiful structure.  David and Sarah Morey moved to Redlands in 1882 where David did carpentry work on many of the local structures and the [[Big Bear, CA|Big Bear]] dam.  Sarah started a citrus nursery using seeds from local growers that became one of the foremost citrus nurseries in the area.  She eventually sold it and used 1/2 the proceeds to build their family home.  After the Morey family sold the house it was alternatively a bed and breakfast and private residence and now serves both functions.  Located on the bluffs overlooking [[San Timoteo Canyon]] it is known for its commanding view.

The Barton School House]], built in 1877, is the oldest building in Redlands. The historic elementary school closed down in the 1960s and has since deteriorated on Nevada Street. In early 2008, construction had become huge in the area surrounding it and in late 2008, the land the property sat on was purchased for construction. Instead of destroying the building, the company paid to move it to Orange Street at [[The Grove School]]&apos;s farm campus. The building has been moved but it is in 3 pieces and will be renovated and remodeled over the next 3 years. It will become the school&apos;s lunch area as well as theater. It is now owned and operated by [[The Grove School]], but the company that moved it will pay to reattach the 3 pieces, with [[The Grove School]] planning to pay for the remodeling.
