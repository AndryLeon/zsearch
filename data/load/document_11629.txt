<title>Sampo</title>
<text>

In [[Finnish mythology]], the Sampo was a [[Artifact (archaeology)|magical artifact]] of indeterminate type constructed by [[Ilmarinen]] that brought good fortune to its holder.  When the Sampo was stolen, it is said that Ilmarinen&apos;s homeland fell upon hard times and sent an expedition to retrieve it, but in the ensuing battle it was smashed and lost at sea.

The Sampo has been interpreted in many ways: a [[Irminsul|world pillar]] or [[world tree]], a [[compass]] or [[astrolabe]], a chest containing a treasure, a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Coining (metalworking)|coin die]], a decorated [[Vendel period]] shield, a Christian [[relic]], etc. In the [[Kalevala]], compiler [[Elias Lönnrot|Lönnrot]] interpreted it to be a [[quern-stone|quern]] or [[mill (grinding)|mill]] of some sort that made [[flour]], [[salt]], and [[gold]] out of thin air. The world pillar theory, originally developed by historian of religions [[Uno Harva]] and linguistic [[Eemil Nestor Setälä]] in the early 20th century, is the most widely accepted one.

The Sampo was a pivotal element of the plot of the Finnish epic poem [[Kalevala]], compiled in 1835 (and expanded in 1849) by [[Elias Lönnrot]] based on earlier Finnish [[oral tradition]].

In the expanded second version of the poem, the Sampo is forged by [[Ilmarinen]], a legendary [[blacksmith|smith]], as a task set by the Mistress of [[Pohjola]] in return for her daughter&apos;s hand.

 &quot;Ilmarinen, worthy brother,
 Thou the only skilful blacksmith,
 Go and see her wondrous beauty,
 See her gold and silver garments,
 See her robed in finest raiment,
 See her sitting on the rainbow,
 Walking on the clouds of purple.
 Forge for her the magic Sampo,
 Forge the lid in many colors,
 Thy reward shall be the virgin,
 Thou shalt win this bride of beauty;
 Go and bring the lovely maiden
 To thy home in Kalevala.&quot;

Ilmarinen works for several days at a mighty forge until finally the Sampo is created: 

 On one side the flour is grinding,
 On another salt is making,
 On a third is money forging,
 And the lid is many-colored.
 Well the Sampo grinds when finished,
 To and fro the lid in rocking,
 Grinds one measure at the day-break,
 Grinds a measure fit for eating,
 Grinds a second for the market,
 Grinds a third one for the store-house.

There is a Finnish brand of diverse products which is called Sampo.

Sampo is also the name of a Christian [[ska]] band.
