La Recoleta Cemetery is a [[List of famous cemeteries|famous cemetery]] located in the exclusive [[Recoleta]] [[barrios de Buenos Aires|neighbourhood]] of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. The layout of the cemetery was designed by the [[French people|French]] engineer [[Próspero Catelin]], and was remodeled in 1881, while [[Torcuato de Alvear]] was mayor of the city, by the Italian architect [[Juan Antonio Buschiazzo]].

The Cemetery includes graves of some of the most influential and important Argentinians, including several [[president of Argentina|presidents]], scientists, and wealthy characters. Internationally, [[Eva Perón]] is the best-known person buried in this cemetery.

The entrance to the cemetery is through neo-classical gates with tall [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] columns. The cemetery contains many elaborate marble [[mausoleum]]s, decorated with statues, in a wide variety of architectural styles. The entire cemetery is laid out in sections like city blocks, with wide tree-lined main walkways branching into sidewalks filled with mausoleums.  

While many of the mausoleums are in fine shape and well-maintained, others have fallen into disrepair.  Several can be found with broken glass and littered with rubbish.

Each mausoleum bears the family name etched into the facade; brass or [[bronze]] plaques are added to the front for particular family members. La Recoleta is one of those cemeteries where the tradition of engraving a death date but no birth date has been maintained.

The cemetery was featured in the educational film [[Destinos]] as the final resting spot of a wife of the main character.
