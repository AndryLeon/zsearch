<title>Iran���Iraq_War</title>
<text>

The Iran–Iraq War, also known as the Imposed War (جنگ تحمیلی, Jang-e-tahmīlī) and Holy Defense (دفاع مقدس, Defā&apos;-e-moghaddas) in Iran, and Saddām&apos;s [[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah|Qādisiyyah]] (قادسيّة صدّام, Qādisiyyat Ṣaddām) in Iraq, was a [[war]] between the armed forces of [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] lasting from September 1980 to August 1988.

The war began when Iraq invaded Iran on 22 September 1980 following a long history of [[Territorial dispute|border disputes]] and fears of [[Shia]] insurgency among Iraq&apos;s long-suppressed Shia majority influenced by the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Although Iraq hoped to take advantage of revolutionary chaos in Iran and attacked without formal warning, they made only limited progress into Iran and within several months were repelled by the Iranians who regained virtually all lost territory by June, 1982. For the next six years, Iran was on the offensive. Despite [[United Nations Security Council Resolutions concerning Iraq|calls for a ceasefire]] by the [[United Nations Security Council]], hostilities continued until 20 August, 1988. The last [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] were exchanged in 2003. and called on Iraqis to overthrow Saddam and his regime. Yet he viewed them and the Sunnis to be victims of oppression by Western hegemony, not sectarianism ( which he was vehemently opposed to). At the same time severe officer purges (including several executions ordered by [[Sadegh Khalkhali]], the post-revolution [[sharia]] ruler), and spare parts shortages for Iran&apos;s American-made equipment, had crippled Iran&apos;s once mighty [[military of Iran|military]]. The bulk of the Iranian military was made up of poorly armed, though committed, [[militia]]s. Iran had minimal defenses in the Shatt al-Arab river.

Iraq started the war believing that Sunnis of Iran would join the opposing forces, failing to fully appreciate the power of Iranian nationalism over historically clan-centered differences, and the power of Iranian government control of the press. Few of the ethnic Arabs of [[Khuzestan]] or Sunnis of Iran collaborated with Iraqis.

Iran&apos;s embassy in London was attacked by Iraqi-sponsored terrorist forces a few months prior to the war in 1980, in what came to be known as the [[Iranian Embassy Siege]].

The [[UN Secretary General]] report dated 9 December 1991 (S/23273) explicitly cites &quot;Iraq&apos;s aggression against Iran&quot; in starting the war and breaching International security and peace.

Iraq&apos;s pretext was an alleged assassination attempt on [[Foreign Minister]] [[Tariq Aziz]] in southern Iraq, which Saddam Hussein blamed on &quot;Iranian agents&quot;, in one of his speeches.

&quot;Relations deteriorated rapidly until in March 1980, Iran unilaterally downgraded its diplomatic ties to the [[charge d&apos;affaires]] level, withdrew its ambassador, and demanded that Iraq do the same. The tension increased in April following the attempted assassination of Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister [[Tariq Aziz]] and, three days later, the bombing of a funeral procession being held to bury students who had died in an earlier attack. Iraq blamed Iran, and in September, attacked.

The objectives of Iraq&apos;s invasion of Iran were:
 Control over the [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway
 Acquisition of the three islands of [[Abu Musa]] and the [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs]], on behalf of the [[UAE]].
 Annexation of [[Khuzestan]] to Iraq
 Prevent the spread of the [[Islamic Revolution]] in the region

[[Iraq]] launched a full-scale invasion of [[Iran]] on 22 September 1980.
On 22 September 1980, the Iraqi air force attacked Iran, attacking ten airfields inside Iran, but failed to achieve their objective of destroying the Iranian air force on the ground.  The next day Iraq initiated a ground invasion of Iran along a front measuring 644 kilometres, in three simultaneous thrusts.  Of the six Iraqi divisions that were invading, four were sent against the  Iranian province of [[Khuzestan]], which was located near the southern end of the border, to cut off the [[Shatt al-Arab]] from the rest of Iran, and to establish a territorial security zone.  Two of the four Iraqi divisions operating near the southern end, one mechanized and one armored, began a siege of the strategically important towns of [[Abadan, Iran|Abadan]] and [[Khorramshahr]].  The Iranian air force also began air strikes in September against strategically important Iraqi targets, including oil facilities, dams, petrochemical plants, and a nuclear reactor near Baghdad.  On 24 October, [[Khorramshahr]] was captured and by November Saddam ordered his forces to advance towards [[Dezful]] and [[Ahvaz]], [[Operation Kaman 99|Over the next day]], 140 Iranian aircraft attacked Iraqi targets, and in a few days the [[IRIAF]] gained air superiority over IQAF, allowing them to conduct ground attack missions with fighter-bombers and helicopters.

Also, rather than turning against the Ayatollah&apos;s government as exiles had promised, the people of Iran rallied around their country and mounted a stiff resistance. An estimated 200,000 additional troops arrived at the front by November, many of them &quot;ideologically committed&quot; volunteers. The Iraqis soon found the Iranian military was not nearly as depleted as they had thought.

For about a year after the Iraqi offensive stalled in March 1981 there was little change in the front, but in mid-March 1982 Iran took the offensive and the Iraqi military was forced to retreat. By June 1982, an Iranian counter-offensive had recovered the areas lost to Iraq earlier in the war. An especially significant battle of this counter-offensive in the Khuzestan province was the [[liberation of Khorramshahr]] from the Iraqis on 24 May 1982.

Saddam decided to withdraw his armed forces completely from Iran, deploying them along the international border between Iraq and Iran.  Karsh describes Saddam&apos;s decision to withdraw his forces from Iran as &quot;one of his wisest strategic moves during the war&quot;.
Iran rejected Iraq&apos;s offer, demanding the removal of the Saddam Hussein regime, the repatriation of 100,000 Shi&apos;ites expelled from Iraq before the war, and $150 billion in war reparations. 

On 21 June, Khomeini indicated that Iran would invade Iraq shortly, and on 22 June, the Iranian Chief-of-Staff [[Shirazi]] declared to &quot;continue the war until Saddam Hussein is overthrown so that we can pray at [[Karbala]] and [[Jerusalem]]&quot;.

Under the slogans &quot;War, War until Victory,&quot; and &quot;The Road to Jerusalem Goes through Karbala,&quot;  Iran advanced.  A tactic used in this advance noted throughout the world was the encouragment of heroism among young Iranian [[basij]] volunteers who sought martyrdom in human wave attacks on Iraqi positions.  The volunteers were inspired before battle by tales of [[Ashura]], the [[Battle of Karbala]], and the supreme glory of [[Istishhad|martyrdom]], and sometimes by an actor (usually a more mature soldier), playing the part of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Imam Hossein]] himself riding a white horse, galloping along the lines, providing the inexperienced soldiers a vision of &quot;the hero who would lead them into their fateful battle before they met their God.&quot; 

On 13 July, the Iranian units crossed the border in force, aiming towards the city of [[Basra]], the second most important city in Iraq.  However the enemy they encountered had entrenched itself in formidable defenses.   Unlike the hastily improvised defenses that the Iraqis had manned in Iran during the 1980–1981 occupation of the conquered territories, the border defenses were, by necessity, well developed even before the war; and the Iraqis were able to utilize a highly-developed network of bunkers and artillery fire-bases. Saddam had also more than doubled the size of the Iraqi army from 1981&apos;s 500,000 soldiers (26 divisions and 3 independent brigades) to 1985&apos;s 1,050,000 (55 divisions and nine brigades).

Saddam&apos;s efforts bore fruit. Iran had been using combined-arms operations to great effect when it was attacking the Iraqi troops in its country, and had launched the iconic human-wave attacks with great support from artillery, aircraft, and tanks. However, lack of ammunition meant that the Iranians were now launching human-wave assaults with no support from other branches of the military. The superior defenses of the Iraqis meant that tens of thousands of Iranian soldiers were lost in most operations after 1982, and the Iraqi defenses would continue to hold in most sectors.

In the Basra offensive, or [[Operation Ramadan]], five human-wave attacks were met with withering fire from the Iraqis. The boy-soldiers of Iran were particularly hard-hit, especially since they volunteered to run into minefields, in order to clear the way for the Iranian soldiers behind them. The Iranians were also hard-hit by the employment of chemical weapons and mustard gas by the Iraqis.

After the failure of their 1982 summer offensives, Iran believed that a major effort along the entire breadth of the front would yield the victory that they desired. Iranian numerical superiority might have achieved a break-through if they had attacked across all parts of the front at the same time, but they still lacked the organization for that type of assault. Iran was getting supplies from countries such as [[North Korea]], [[Libya]], and China. The Iraqis had more suppliers such as the [[USSR]], the [[NATO]] nations, [[France]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Brazil]], [[Yugoslavia]], Spain, Italy, [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the United States.

During the course of 1983, the Iranians launched five major assaults along the front. None met with substantial success. Khomeini&apos;s position on a truce remained unchanged.

In February 1984, Saddam ordered aerial and missile attacks against the eleven cities that he had designated. The bombardment ceased on 22 February 1984. Iran soon retaliated against urban centers, and these exchanges become known as the first &quot;war of the cities&quot;. There would be five throughout the course of the war.

The attacks on the Iranian cities did not destroy the Iranian government&apos;s resolve to fight. On 15 February, the Iranians launched a major attack against the central section of the front where the Second Iraqi Army Corps was deployed. 250,000 Iranians faced 250,000 Iraqis.

From 15 to 22 February, in [[Operation Dawn 5]], and 22 to 24 February, in [[Operation Dawn 6]], the Iranians attempted to capture the vital town of Kut al-Amara and to cut the key highway linking Baghdad and Basra. Capture of this road would have made it extremely difficult for the Iraqis to supply and co-ordinate the defenses, but the Iranian forces only came within  of the highway.

However, [[Operation Khaibar]] met with much greater success. Involving a number of thrusts towards the key Iraqi city of [[Basra]], the operation started on the 24 February and lasted until 19 March. The Iraqi defenses, under continuous strain since 15 February, seemed close to breaking conclusively. The Iraqis successfully stabilized the front but not before the Iranians captured part of the [[Majnun Islands]]. Despite a heavy Iraqi counterattack coupled with the use of [[mustard gas]] and [[sarin]] [[nerve gas]], the Iranians held their gains and would continue to hold them almost until the end of the war.

In 1982 with Iranian success on the battlefield, the U.S. made its backing of Iraq more pronounced, supplying it with intelligence, economic aid, normalizing relations with the government (broken during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]), and also supplying &quot;dual-use&quot; equipment and vehicles. Dual use items are civilian items such as heavy trucks, armored ambulances and communications gear as well as industrial technology that can have a military application. President Ronald Reagan decided that the United States &quot;could not afford to allow Iraq to lose the war to Iran&quot;, and that the United States &quot;would do whatever was necessary to prevent Iraq from losing the war with Iran.&quot; President Reagan formalized this policy by issuing a National Security Decision Directive (&quot;NSDD&quot;) to this effect in June, 1982.

[[Lloyd&apos;s of London]], a British [[insurance]] [[market]], estimated that the Tanker War damaged 546 commercial vessels and killed about 430 civilian mariners. The largest portion of the attacks were directed by Iran against Kuwaiti vessels, and on 1 November 1986, Kuwait formally petitioned foreign powers to protect its shipping. The [[Soviet Union]] agreed to charter tankers starting in 1987, and the United States offered to provide protection for tankers [[flag of convenience|flying the U.S. flag]] on 7 March 1987 ([[Operation Earnest Will]] and [[Operation Prime Chance]]).

However, U.S. attention was focused on isolating Iran as well as [[freedom of navigation]], criticizing Iran&apos;s mining of international waters, and sponsored [[s:United Nations Security Council Resolution 598|UN Security Council Resolution 598]], which passed unanimously on 20 July, under which it skirmished with Iranian forces. During the [[Operation Nimble Archer]] in October 1987, the U.S. attacked Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian attack on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker [[MV Sea Isle City|Sea Isle City]].

On 14 April 1988, the frigate [[USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58)|USS Samuel B. Roberts]] was badly damaged by an Iranian mine, suffering 10 wounded but no dead. U.S. forces responded with [[Operation Praying Mantis]] on 18 April, the [[United States Navy]]&apos;s largest engagement of surface warships since [[World War II]]. Two Iranian oil platforms, two Iranian ships and six Iranian gunboats were destroyed. An American helicopter also crashed. The Iranians, however, maintain that the Vincennes was in fact in Iranian territorial waters, and that the Iranian passenger jet was turning away and increasing altitude after take-off. U.S. Admiral [[William J. Crowe]] also admitted on [[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]] that the Vincennes was inside Iranian territorial waters when it launched the missiles. At the time, the captain of the Vincennes claimed that the Iranian plane did not identify itself and sent no response to warning signals from the Vincennes. Apart from Iran, other independent sources, for example the airport of Dubai, have confirmed that the plane did indeed identify itself to the American naval ship and also confirmed that &quot;the civilian aircraft was ascending and therefore could not have posed a threat,&quot; agreeing with Iranian officials.

According to an investigation conducted by ABC News&apos; Nightline, decoys were set during the war by the US Navy inside the [[Persian Gulf]] to lure out the Iranian gunboats and destroy them, and at the time USS Vincennes shot down the Iranian airliner, it was performing such an operation.

In 1996 the U.S. expressed regret only for the loss of innocent life, and did not make a specific apology to the Iranian government.

The shooting down of a civilian Iranian passenger plane Iran Air Flight 655 by the American cruiser USS Vincennes, was cited by an Iranian scholar  as apparently giving [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] reason to withdraw from the conflict:

Toward the end of the war, the land conflict regressed into [[stalemate]] largely because neither side had enough self-propelled artillery or air power to support ground advances.

The relatively professional Iraqi armed forces could not make headway against the far more numerous Iranian [[infantry]]. The Iranians were outmatched in towed and self-propelled [[artillery]], which left their tanks and troops vulnerable. What followed was the Iranians substituting infantry for artillery.

Iraq&apos;s air force soon began [[strategic bombing]] against Iranian cities, chiefly [[Tehran]], in 1985. To minimize losses from the superior Iranian Air Force, Iraq rapidly switched to [[Scud]] and [[Al Hussein (missile)|Al-Hussein]] improved Scud launches. In retaliation, Iran fired [[Scud]] missiles acquired from Libya and Syria against [[Baghdad]]. In all, Iraq launched 520 Scuds and Al-Husseins against Iran and received only 177 in exchange. In October 1986, Iraqi aircraft attacked civilian passenger trains and aircraft, including an [[Iran Air]] Boeing 737 unloading passengers at [[Shiraz International Airport]].

In retaliation for the Iranian [[Operation Karbala-5]], an early 1987 attempt to capture Basra, Iraq attacked 65 cities in 226 sorties over 42 days, bombing civilian neighborhoods. Eight Iranian cities came under attack from Iraqi missiles. The bombings killed 65 children in an elementary school in [[Borujerd]] alone. The Iranians also responded with Scud missile attacks on Baghdad and struck a primary school there. These events became known as &quot;the war of the cities&quot;.

In their documentary [[Saddam Hussein-The Trial You Will Never See]], made for European audience, [[Barry Lando]] and [[Michel Despratx]] reveal that United States secretary of state [[Alexander Meigs Haig Jr.]] wrote in a secret memo to President [[Ronald Reagan]], about United States previous president [[Jimmy Carter]]&apos;s green light to [[Saddam Hussein]] for launching a war against Iran using [[Saudi Arabia]] delivering the go ahead message to Iraqis. Furthermore it has been reported, United States support for [[Saddam Hussein]] during his war with Iran, was to gain access to oil fields in the region.
[[British support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq war]] especially illustrated the ways by which Iraq would circumvent export controls. Iraq bought at least one British company with operations in the U.K. and the U.S.

Iraq had a complex relationship with France and the [[Soviet Union]], its major suppliers of actual weapons, to some extent having the two nations compete for its business.

[[Singapore support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq war]] discusses land mines assembled there, as well as chemical warfare precursors shipped from Singapore, possibly by an Iraqi front company.

Another country that had an important role in arming Iraq was Italy, whose greatest impact was financial, through the U.S. branch of the state-owned largest bank in Italy. The Italian article is one example of how Iraq circumvented a national embargo, by, as one example, moving land and sea mine production to Singapore.

Additional country details will be added as the articles become available, in some cases in stub format for individual yet significant support, such as providing the largest amount of precursor chemicals from which chemical weapons were produced.

Although the [[United Nations Security Council]] called for a cease-fire after a week of fighting and renewed the call on later occasions, the initial call was made while Iraq occupied Iranian territory. Moreover, the UN refused to come to Iran&apos;s aid to repel the Iraqi invasion. The Iranians thus interpreted the UN as subtly biased in favor of Iraq. This scandal is covered in Alan Friedman&apos;s book The Spider&apos;s Web: The Secret History of How the White House Illegally Armed Iraq.

Beginning in September 1989, the [[Financial Times]] laid out the first charges that BNL, relying heavily on U.S. government-guaranteed loans, was funding Iraqi chemical and nuclear weapons work. For the next two and a half years, the Financial Times provided the only continuous newspaper reportage (over 300 articles) on the subject. Among the companies shipping militarily useful technology to Iraq under the eye of the U.S. government, according to the Financial Times, were [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Tektronix]], and [[Arms-to-Iraq|Matrix Churchill]], through its [[Ohio]] branch. 

In all, Iraq received $35 billion in loans from the West and between $30 and $40 billion from the Persian Gulf states during the 1980s.

With more than 100,000 Iranian victims of Iraq&apos;s chemical weapons during the eight-year war, [[Iran]] is one of the countries most severely afflicted by &quot;[[weapons of mass destruction]]&quot;.

The official estimate does not include the civilian population contaminated in bordering towns or the children and relatives of veterans, many of whom have developed blood, lung and skin complications, according to the Organization for Veterans of Iran. According to a 2002 article in the [[Star-Ledger]]:

&quot;Nerve gas killed about 20,000 Iranian soldiers immediately, according to official reports. Of the 90,000 survivors, some 5,000 seek medical treatment regularly and about 1,000 are still hospitalized with severe, chronic conditions.&quot;

Iraq also used chemical weapons on Iranian civilians, killing many in villages and hospitals. Many civilians suffered severe burns and health problems, and still suffer from them. There is great resentment in Iran  that the international community helped Iraq develop its chemical weapons arsenal and armed forces, and also that the world did nothing to punish Saddam&apos;s Ba&apos;athist regime for its use of chemical weapons against Iran throughout the war — particularly since the US and other western powers soon felt obliged to oppose the Iraqi invasion of [[Kuwait]] and eventually invade Iraq itself to remove Saddam Hussein.

The U.S. [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] also accused Iran of using chemical weapons. These allegations however, have been disputed. [[Joost Hiltermann]], who was the principal researcher for [[Human Rights Watch]] between 1992–1994, conducted a two year study, including a field investigation in Iraq, capturing Iraqi government documents in the process. According to Hiltermann, the literature on the Iran–Iraq War reflects a number of allegations of chemical weapons use by Iran, but these are &quot;marred by a lack of specificity as to time and place, and the failure to provide any sort of evidence&quot;.

In an edited volume by Gary Sick and Laurence Potter, Hiltermann calls the allegations that Iran too, and not only Iraq, used chemical weapons &quot;mere assertions&quot; and states: &quot;no persuasive evidence of the claim that Iran was the primary culprit [of using chemical weapons] was ever presented&quot;. Policy consultant and author [[Joseph Tragert]] also states: &quot;Iran did not retaliate with chemical weapons, probably because it did not possess any at the time&quot;.

At his trial in December 2006, Saddam Hussein said he would take responsibility &quot;with honour&quot; for any attacks on Iran using conventional or chemical weapons during the 1980–1988 war but he took issue with charges he ordered attacks on Iraqis. A medical analysis of the effects of Iraqi [[mustard gas]] is described in a U.S. military textbook, and contrasted, resulting in slightly different effects in the First World War.

Iran [[Iranian Air Force in Iran-Iraq war|attacked]] and partially damaged the [[Osirak]] [[nuclear reactor]] on September 30, 1980 with two [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantoms]], shortly after the outbreak of the [[Iran-Iraq War]]. This was the first attack on a [[nuclear reactor]] and only the third on a nuclear facility in history of the world. It was also the first instance of a [[pre-emptive]] attack on a nuclear reactor to forestall the development of a [[nuclear weapon]], though it did not achieve its objective as [[France]] repaired the reactor after the Iranian attack. It took a second [[pre-emptive]] strike by the [[Israeli Airforce]] to disable the reactor, in the process killing a French engineer and causing [[France]] to pull out of [[Osirak]]. The decommissioning of [[Osirak]] has been cited as causing a substantial delay to Iraqi acquisition of [[nuclear weapon]]s, which [[Saddam]] announced an intention to develop in response to the Iranian revolution. But not only the invasion of [[Kuwait]] did not help with Iraq&apos;s financial situation, but it also made it much worse as [[United Nations Compensation Commission]] awarded reparations amounting more than $200 billion dollars to victims of the invasion including [[Kuwait]], [[United States]], individuals and companies among others, to be paid by Iraq in oil commodity as well as putting Iraq under a complete international embargo. This put further strain on Iraqi [[economy]] pushing its [[external debt]] and international liabilities to private and public sectors including the interests on them by the end of [[Saddam]]&apos;s rule, to more than $500 billion which combined with negative economic growth of Iraq after the prolonged international sanctions produced a [[Debt-to-GDP ratio]] of more than 1,000% (10 Years), making Iraq the most indebted poor country in the world. This unsustainable economic situation compelled the new Iraqi government formed after the fall of [[Saddam]] to request the forgiveness of a considerable portion of loans incurred during Iran Iraq war.  

Much of the oil industry in both countries was damaged in [[airstrike|air raids]]. Iran&apos;s production capacity has yet to fully recover from the damages of the war. 10 million shells had landed in Iraq&apos;s oil fields at Basra, seriously damaging Iraq&apos;s oil production. Prisoners taken by both sides were not released until more than 10 years after the end of the conflict. Cities on both sides had also been considerably damaged.
Not all saw the war in negative terms. The Islamic Revolution of Iran was strengthened and radicalized. The Iranian government-owned Etelaat newspaper wrote:
&quot;There is not a single school or town that is excluded from the happiness of &quot;holy defence&quot; of the nation, from drinking the exquisite elixir of martyrdom, or from the sweet death of the martyr, who dies in order to live forever in paradise.&quot; 

The Iraqi government commemorated the war with various monuments, including the [[Hands of Victory]] and the [[Al-Shaheed Monument]], both in Baghdad.

The war left the [[border]]s unchanged. Two years later, as war with the western powers loomed, Saddam recognized Iranian rights over the eastern half of the Shatt al-Arab, a reversion to the status quo ante bellum that he had repudiated a decade earlier.

Declassified US intelligence available has explored both the domestic and foreign implications of Iran&apos;s apparent (in 1982) victory over Iraq in their then two-year old war.

On 9 December 1991, the UN Secretary-General reported the following to the UN Security Council:

&quot;That Iraq&apos;s explanations do not appear sufficient or acceptable to the international community is a fact. Accordingly, the outstanding event under the violations referred to is the attack of 22 September 1980, against Iran, which cannot be justified under the charter of the United Nations, any recognized rules and principles of international law or any principles of international morality and entails the responsibility for conflict.&quot;

&quot;Even if before the outbreak of the conflict there had been some encroachment by Iran on Iraqi territory, such encroachment did not justify Iraq&apos;s aggression against Iran—which was followed by Iraq&apos;s continuous occupation of Iranian territory during the conflict—in violation of the prohibition of the use of force, which is regarded as one of the rules of jus cogens.&quot;

&quot;On one occasion I had to note with deep regret the experts&apos; conclusion that &quot;chemical weapons had been used against Iranian civilians in an area adjacent to an urban center lacking any protection against that kind of attack&quot; (s/20134, annex). The Council expressed its dismay on the matter and its condemnation in resolution 620 (1988), adopted on 26 August 1988.&quot;
