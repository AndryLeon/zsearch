<text>

A frigate () is a [[warship]]. The term has been used for warships of many sizes and roles over the past few centuries.

In the [[17th century]], the term was used for any warship built for speed and maneuverability, the description often used being &quot;frigate-built&quot;. These could be warships carrying their principal battery of carriage-mounted [[Naval artillery|guns]] on a single [[deck (ship)|deck]] or on two decks (with further smaller carriage-mounted guns usually carried on the forecastle and quarterdeck of the vessel). The term was generally used for ships too small to stand in the [[line of battle]], although early line-of-battle ships were frequently referred to as frigates when they were built for speed.

In the [[18th century]], the term referred to ships which were usually as long as a [[ship-of-the-line]] and were [[square rig|square-rigged]] on all three masts ([[full rigged]]), but were faster and with lighter armament, used for patrolling and escort. In the definition adopted by the [[British Admiralty]], they were [[Rating system of the Royal Navy|Rated ships]] of at least 28 guns, carrying their principal armament upon a single continuous deck - the upper deck, while ships-of-the-line possessed two or more continuous decks bearing batteries of guns. Frigates did not carry any guns (or have any gunports) on their lower decks; confusingly, the lower deck was often referred to as the &quot;gun deck&quot; in the [[British Navy]] (in the [[American Navy]], it was usually called the &quot;berth deck&quot;), even for frigates, where it did not carry any guns or have gunports. Both types could (and usually did) additionally carry smaller carriage-mounted guns on their quarter decks and [[forecastle]]s (the superstructures above the upper deck). Technically, rated ships with fewer than 28 guns could not be classed as frigates but as &quot;[[Post-ship]]s&quot;; however, in common parlance most Post-ships were often described as &apos;frigates&apos;, the same casual misuse of the term being extended to smaller two-decked ships that were too small to stand in the line of battle.

In the late [[19th century]] (beginning about 1858 with the construction of prototypes by the British and French navies), the armoured frigate was a type of [[ironclad warship]] and for a time was the most powerful type of vessel afloat. The term &apos;frigate&apos; was used because such ships still mounted their principal armament on a single continuous upper deck. The later 19th century [[battleship]] thus developed from the frigate rather than from the [[ship of the line]].

In modern navies, frigates are used to protect other warships and [[merchant-marine]] ships, especially as [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces, underway replenishment groups, and merchant [[convoy]]s. But ship classes dubbed &quot;frigates&quot; have also more closely resembled [[corvette]]s, [[destroyer]]s, [[cruiser]]s and even [[battleship]]s.

The rank [[Frigate Captain]] derives from the name of this type of ship.

The term &quot;frigate&quot; (Italian: fregata; Spanish/Catalan/Portuguese/Sicilian: fragata; Dutch: &quot;fregat&quot;) originated in the [[Mediterranean]] in the late 15th century, referring to a lighter [[Galley#Galleass|galleass]] type ship with oars, sails and a light armament, built for speed and maneuverability.

In 1583, during the [[Eighty Years&apos; War]], [[Habsburg Spain]] recovered the [[Southern Netherlands]] from the rebellious [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]]. This soon led to the occupied ports being used as bases for [[privateers]], the [[Dunkirker]]s, to attack the shipping of the Dutch and their allies. To achieve this they developed small, maneuverable, sail-only vessels that came to be referred to as frigates.  Because most regular navies required ships of greater endurance than the Dunkirker frigates could provide, the useful term &apos;frigate&apos; was soon applied less exclusively to any relatively fast and elegant sail-only ship, such that much later even the mighty English  was described as &apos;a delicate frigate&apos; after modifications in 1651.

The navy of the [[Dutch Republic]] was the first regular navy to build the larger ocean-going frigates. The Dutch navy had three principal tasks in the struggle against Spain: to protect Dutch merchant ships at sea, to blockade the ports of Spanish-held [[Flanders]] to damage trade and halt enemy [[privateering]], and to fight the Spanish fleet and prevent troop landings. The first two tasks required speed, shallowness of draft for the shallow waters around the Netherlands, and the ability to carry sufficient supplies to maintain a blockade. The third task required heavy armament, sufficient to fight against the Spanish fleet. The first of these larger battle-capable frigates were built around 1600 at [[Hoorn]] in [[Holland]]. By the later stages of the [[Eighty Years War]] the Dutch had switched entirely from the heavier ships still used by the English and Spanish to the lighter frigates, carrying around 40 guns and weighing around 300 tons.

The effectiveness of the Dutch frigates became most visible in the [[Battle of the Downs]] in 1639, triggering most other navies, especially the English, to adopt similar innovations.

The fleets built by the [[Commonwealth of England]] in the 1650s generally consisted of ships described as &apos;frigates&apos;, the largest of which were two-decker &apos;great frigates&apos; of the [[third rate]]. Carrying 60 guns, these vessels were as big and capable as &apos;great ships&apos; of the time; however, most other frigates at the time were used as &apos;[[cruiser]]s&apos;: independent fast ships. The term &apos;frigate&apos; implied a long hull design, which relates directly to speed (see [[hull speed]]) and also, in turn, helped the development of the [[broadside]] tactic in naval warfare.

At this time a further design evolved, reintroducing oars to create the galley frigate such as the Charles Galley of 1676 which was rated as a 32 gun fifth rate but also had a bank of 40 oars set below the upper deck which could be used to propel the ship in the absence of a favourable wind.

;
In French, the term &apos;frigate&apos; became a verb, meaning &apos;to build long and low&apos;, and an adjective, adding further confusion. 

Under the [[rating system of the Royal Navy]], by the middle of the 18th century, the term &apos;frigate&apos; was technically restricted to single-decked ships of the [[fifth rate]], though small 28-gun frigates were classed as [[sixth rate]].

The classic sailing frigate, well-known today for its role in the [[Napoleonic wars]], can be traced back to French developments in the second quarter of the 18th century. The French-built Médée of 1740 is often regarded as the first example of this type. These ships were square-rigged and carried all their main guns on a single continuous upper deck. The lower deck, known as the &quot;gun deck&quot;, now carried no armament, and functioned as a &quot;berth deck&quot; where the crew lived, and was in fact placed below the waterline of the new frigates. The new sailing frigates were able to fight with all their guns when the seas were so rough that comparable two-deckers had to close the gun-ports on their lower decks (see the [[Action of 13 January 1797]], for an example when this was decisive). Like the larger 74 which was developed at the same time, the new frigates sailed very well and were good fighting vessels due to a combination of long hulls and low upperworks compared to vessels of comparable size and firepower.

The [[Royal Navy]] captured a handful of the new French frigates during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740–1748) and were impressed by them, particularly for their inshore handling capabilities. They soon built copies and started to adapt the type to their own needs, setting the standard for other frigates as a superpower. The first British frigates carried 28 guns including an upper deck battery of twenty-four 9-pounder guns (the remaining four smaller guns were carried on the quarter deck) but soon developed into Fifth Rates ships of 32 or 36 guns including an upper deck battery of twenty-six 12-pounder guns (with the remaining six or ten smaller guns carried on the quarter deck and forecastle). From around 1778, a larger &quot;heavy&quot; frigate was developed with a main battery of twenty-six or twenty-eight 18-pounder guns (again with the remaining ten smaller guns carried on the quarter deck and forecastle).

Royal Navy frigates of the late 18th century included the 1780-vintage Perseverance class, which measured around 900 [[Builder&apos;s Old Measurement|tons burthen]] and carried 36 guns; this successful class was followed by numerous other classes that measured over 1,000 tons burthen and carried 38 guns.

In 1797, three of the [[US Navy]]&apos;s [[original six frigates of the United States Navy|first six major ships]] were 44-gun frigates (or &quot;super-frigates&quot;), which actually carried fifty-six to sixty 24-pounder long guns and 36-pounder or 48-pounder [[carronade]]s on two decks, and were exceptionally powerful and tough. These ships were so well-armed that they were often seen as equal to smaller ships of the line and, after a series of losses at the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]], Royal Navy fighting instructions ordered British frigates (usually of 38 guns or less) to never engage American frigates at any less than a 2:1 advantage. , preserved as a museum ship by the US Navy, is the oldest commissioned frigate afloat, and is a surviving example of a frigate from the [[Age of Sail]].  Constitution and her two sister ships ([[USS President (1800)|USS President]] and [[USS United States (1797)|USS United States]]) were created in a response to deal with the Barbary Coast pirates and in conjunction with the [[Naval Act of 1794]].  The three big frigates, when built, had a distinctive building pattern which minimized &quot;[[Hogging and sagging|hogging]]&quot; (in which the centre of the keel rises while both ends drop) and improves hydrodynamic efficiency. The hull was designed so that all the weight from the guns was upon the keel itself.  [[Joshua Humphreys]] proposed that only [[live oak]], a tree that grew only in America, should be used to build these ships.  The method was to use diagonal riders, eight on each side that sat a 45 degree angle.  These beams of live oak were about two feet wide and around a foot thick and helped to maintain the shape of the hull, serving also to reduce flexibility and to minimize impacts. These ideas were considered revolutionary in the late 18th and early 19th century.  A three-layer method was used in which the planks along the sides of the hull were laid horizontally across the ribs, making a crossing or checker board pattern.  The sides of the ship could be as thick as 25 inches, and were able to absorb substantial damage.  The strength of this braced construction earned USS Constitution the nickname &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;.

Frigates were perhaps the hardest-worked of warship types during the [[Age of Sail]]. While smaller than a [[ship-of-the-line]], they were formidable opponents for the large numbers of [[sloop]]s and [[gunboat]]s, not to mention [[privateer]]s or merchantmen. Able to carry six months&apos; stores, they had very long range; and vessels larger than frigates were considered too valuable to operate independently.

Frigates scouted for the fleet, went on commerce-raiding missions and patrols, conveyed messages and dignitaries. Usually frigates would fight in small numbers or singly against other frigates. They would avoid contact with [[ships-of-the-line]]; even in the midst of a fleet engagement it was bad etiquette for a ship of the line to fire on an enemy frigate which had not fired first. 

For officers in the Royal Navy a frigate was a desirable posting. Frigates often saw action, which meant a greater chance of glory, promotion, and [[prize money]].

Unlike larger ships that were placed [[Reserve Fleet|in ordinary]], frigates were kept in service in peacetime as a cost-saving measure and to provide experience to frigate captains and officers which would be useful in wartime. Frigates could also carry [[marines]] for boarding enemy ships or for operations on shore.

Frigate armament ranged from 22 guns on one deck to 60 guns on two decks. Common armament was 32 to 44 long guns, from 8- to 24-pounders (3.6 to 11 kg), plus a few [[carronade]]s (large bore short-range guns).

Frigates remained a crucial element of navies until the mid-19th century. The first [[ironclad]]s were classified as &apos;frigates&apos; because of the number of guns they carried. However, terminology changed as iron and steam became the norm, and the role of the frigate was assumed first by the [[protected cruiser]] and then by the [[light cruiser]].

Frigates are often the vessel of choice in historical naval novels due to their relative freedom compared to ships of the line (kept for fleet actions) and smaller vessels (generally assigned to a home port and less widely ranging). For example the [[Patrick O&apos;Brian]] [[Aubrey–Maturin series]], [[C. S. Forester]]&apos;s [[Horatio Hornblower]] series and [[Alexander Kent]]&apos;s [[Richard Bolitho]] series. The motion picture [[Master and Commander]] features a reconstructed historic frigate, [[HMS Surprise (replica ship)|HMS Rose]], to depict Aubrey&apos;s frigate HMS Surprise.

Vessels classed as frigates continued to play a great role in navies with the adoption of steam power in the 19th century. In the 1830s navies experimented with large [[paddle steamer]]s equipped with large guns mounted on one deck, which were termed &apos;paddle frigates&apos;. From the mid-1840s frigates which more closely resembled the traditional sailing frigate were built with steam engines and screw [[propeller]]s. These &apos;[[screw frigate]]s&apos;, built first of wood and later of [[Wrought iron|iron]], continued to perform the traditional role of the frigate until late in the 19th century.

From 1859, armour was added to ships based on existing frigate and [[ship of the line]] designs. The additional weight of the armour on these first [[ironclad warship]]s meant that they could have only one gun deck, and they were technically frigates, even though they were more powerful than existing ships-of-the-line and occupied the same strategic role. The phrase &apos;armoured frigate&apos; remained in use for some time to denote a sail-equipped, broadside-firing type of ironclad.

Towards the end of the 19th century, the term &apos;frigate&apos; fell out of use. Armoured vessels were designated as either &apos;[[battleship]]s&apos; or &apos;[[armoured cruiser]]s&apos;, while unarmoured vessels including frigates and sloops were classified as &apos;unprotected cruisers&apos;.

Modern frigates are related to earlier frigates only by name. The term &quot;frigate&quot; was readopted during [[World War II]] by the [[Royal Navy]] to describe a new type of [[anti-submarine]] escort vessel that was larger than a [[corvette]], but smaller than a [[destroyer]]. The frigate was introduced to remedy some of the shortcomings inherent in the corvette design: limited armament, a hull form not suited to open-ocean work, a single [[driveshaft|shaft]] which limited speed and maneuverability, and a lack of range. The frigate was designed and built to the same mercantile construction standards ([[scantling]]s) as the corvette, allowing manufacture by yards unused to warship construction. The first frigates of the [[River class frigate|River class]] (1941) were essentially two sets of corvette machinery in one larger hull, armed with the latest [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] anti-submarine weapon. The frigate possessed less offensive firepower and speed than a [[destroyer]], but such qualities were not required for anti-submarine warfare. Submarines were slow, and [[ASDIC]] sets did not operate effectively at speeds of over 20 [[knot (speed)|knots]]. Rather, the frigate was an austere and weatherly vessel suitable for mass-construction and fitted with the latest innovations in anti-submarine warfare. As the frigate was intended purely for convoy duties, and not to deploy with the fleet, it had limited range and speed.

The contemporaneous [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Flottenbegleiter]] (&quot;fleet escorts&quot;), also known as &quot;F-Boats&quot; were essentially frigates. They were based on a pre-war [[Oberkommando der Marine]] concept of vessels which could fill roles such as fast minesweeper, minelayer, merchant escort and anti-submarine vessel. Because of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] their displacement was officially limited to 600 tons, although in reality they exceeded this by about 100 tons. F-boats had two stacks and two 105 mm gun turrets. The design was flawed because of its narrow beam, sharp bow and unreliable high pressure steam turbines. F-boats suffered relatively heavy losses and were succeeded in operational duties later in the war by [[Torpedo boat type 35|Type 35]] and [[Elbing class torpedo boat|Elbing class]] torpedo boats. Flottenbegleiter remained in service as advanced training vessels.

It was not until the Royal Navy&apos;s [[Bay class frigate|Bay class]] of 1944 that a British design bearing the name of frigate was produced for fleet use, although it still suffered from limited speed. These frigates were similar to the [[United States Navy]]&apos;s (USN) [[destroyer escort]]s (DE), although the latter had greater speed and offensive armament to better suit them to fleet deployments. American DEs serving in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] were rated as frigates, and British-influenced [[Tacoma class frigate|Tacoma class]] frigates serving in the USN were classed as patrol frigates (PF). One of the most successful post-1945 designs was the British [[Leander class frigate|Leander class frigate]], which was used by several navies.

The introduction of the [[surface-to-air missile]] after the Second World War made relatively small ships effective for anti-aircraft warfare (AAW): the &quot;guided missile frigate.&quot;  In the USN, these vessels were called &quot;[[Ocean escort|Ocean Escort]]s&quot; and [[hull classification symbol|designated]] &quot;DE&quot; or &quot;DEG&quot; until 1975 - a holdover from the World War II [[Destroyer escort|Destroyer Escort]] or DE. The British [[Royal Navy]] maintained the use of the term &quot;frigate.&quot; Soviet Navy used the term &quot;guard-ship&quot; (сторожевой корабль).

From the 1950s to the 1970s, the [[USN]] commissioned ships classed as guided missile frigates which were actually AAW [[cruiser]]s built on [[destroyer]]-style hulls. Some of these ships—the [[Bainbridge class cruiser|Bainbridge-]], [[Truxtun class cruiser|Truxtun-]], [[California class cruiser|California-]] and [[Virginia class cruiser|Virginia-]] classes—were [[nuclear fission|nuclear-powered]]. These were larger than any previous frigates and the use of the term frigate here is much more analogous to its original use. All such ships were reclassified as guided missile cruisers (CG / CGN) or, in the case of the smaller [[Farragut class destroyer (1958)|Farragut-class]], as  [[guided missile destroyer]]s (DDG) in 1975. The last of these particular frigates were struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] in the 1990s.

Nearly all modern frigates are equipped with some form of offensive or defensive missiles, and as such are rated as guided-missile frigates (FFG). Improvements in surface-to-air missiles (e.g., the [[Eurosam]] [[MBDA Aster|Aster 15]]) allow modern guided-missile frigates to form the core of many modern navies and to be used as a fleet defence platform, without the need for specialised AAW frigates.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, some frigates are specialised for [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW). Increasing submarine speeds towards the end of the Second World War (see [[German Type XXI submarine]]) greatly reduced the margin of speed superiority of frigate over submarine. The frigate could no longer be slow and powered by mercantile machinery and consequently postwar frigates, such as the [[Type 12 frigate|Whitby class]], were faster. Such ships carry improved [[sonar]] equipment, such as the [[variable depth sonar]] or [[towed array sonar|towed array]], and specialised weapons such as [[torpedo]]es, forward-throwing weapons such as [[Limbo (weapon)|Limbo]] and missile-carried anti-submarine torpedoes such as [[ASROC]] or [[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]]. Surface-to-air missiles such as [[AIM-7 Sparrow#Sea Sparrow|Sea Sparrow]] and surface-to-surface missiles such as [[Exocet]] give them defensive and offensive capabilities. The Royal Navy&apos;s original [[Type 22 frigate]] is an example of a specialised ASW frigate.

Especially for ASW, most modern frigates have a [[Helipad|landing deck]] and [[hangar]] aft to operate [[helicopter]]s, eliminating the need for the frigate to close with unknown sub-surface threats, and using fast helicopters to attack nuclear submarines which may be faster than surface warships. For this task the helicopter is equipped with sensors such as [[sonobuoy]]s, wire-mounted dipping sonar and [[magnetic anomaly detector]]s to identify possible threats, and  torpedoes or [[depth-charge]]s to attack them. With their onboard radar helicopters can also be used to reconnoitre over-the-horizon targets and, if equipped with [[anti-ship missile]]s such as [[Penguin missile|Penguin]] or [[Sea Skua]], to attack them. The helicopter is also invaluable for [[search and rescue]] operation and has largely replaced the use of [[dinghy|small boats]] or the [[Yard (sailing)#Going aloft|jackstay rig]] for such duties as transferring personnel, mail and cargo between ships or to shore. With helicopters these tasks can be accomplished faster and less dangerously, and without the need for the frigate to slow down or change course.

[[Stealth technology]] has been introduced in modern frigate design. Frigate shapes are designed to offer a minimal [[radar cross section]], which also lends them good air penetration; the maneuverability of these frigates has been compared to that of sailing ships. Examples are the French [[La Fayette class frigate|La Fayette-class]] with the [[MBDA Aster|Aster 15]] missile for anti-missile capabilities, the [[Germany|German]] [[F125|F125 class]] and [[Sachsen class frigate]]s and also the Turkish [[Milgem]] type corvettes and [[TF-2000]] type Frigates with the [[MK-41 VLS]].

The modern [[French Navy]] applies the term frigate to both frigates and destroyers in service.  Pennant numbers remain divided between F-series numbers for those ships internationally recognized as frigates and D-series pennant numbers for those more traditionally recognized as destroyers. This can result in some confusion as certain classes are referred to as frigates in French service while similar ships in other navies are referred to as destroyers. This also results in some recent classes of French ships being among the largest in the world to carry the rating of frigate.

Also in the [[German Navy]] frigates were used to replace aging destroyers; however in size and role the new German frigates exceed the former class of destroyers. The future German [[F125 class frigate]] will be the largest class of frigates worldwide with a displacement of 7,200 tons.
The same was done in the [[Spanish Navy]], which went ahead with the deployment of the first [[Aegis combat system|Aegis]] frigates, the [[Álvaro de Bazán class frigate|F-100]] class frigates.

Some new classes of frigates are optimized for high-speed deployment and combat with small craft rather than combat between equal opponents; an example is the U.S. [[Littoral Combat Ship]].
