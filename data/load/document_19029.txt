<title>Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse)</title>
<text>

Alix of Hesse and by Rhine (later Alexandra Feodorovna Romanova () (6 June 1872 â€“ 17 July 1918), was [[Queen consort|Empress consort]] of [[Russia]] as spouse of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], the last [[Emperor]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. Born a granddaughter of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] of the [[United Kingdom]], she was given the name Alexandra Feodorovna upon being received into the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], which canonised her as Saint Alexandra the Passion Bearer in 2000.

Alexandra is best remembered as the last [[Tsaritsa]] of Russia, as one of the most famous  [[Haemophilia in European royalty|royal carriers of the haemophilia disease]], as well as for her support of autocratic control over the country. Her notorious friendship with the Russian mystic [[Grigori Rasputin]] was also an important factor in her life.

Alexandra was born on 6 June 1872 at the New Palace in [[Darmstadt]] as Princess Viktoria Alix Helena Luise Beatrice of [[Hesse|Hesse and by Rhine]], a [[Grand Duchy]] that was then part of the [[German Empire]]. She was the sixth child among the seven children of [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse|Grand Duke Louis IV of Hesse and by Rhine]], and  [[Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]], the second daughter of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort]].

Alix was baptized on 1 July 1872 according to the rites of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]] and given the names of her mother and each of her mother&apos;s four sisters, some of which were transliterated into German. Her godparents were [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|the Prince of Wales]], [[Alexandra of Denmark|the Princess of Wales]], [[Alexander III of Russia|the Tsarevich of Russia]], [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|the Tsarevna of Russia]], [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom]], [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel|the Duchess of Cambridge]] and [[Princess Anna of Prussia|Anna of Prussia]].

In December, 1878, [[diphtheria]] swept through the grandducal house of Hesse. Alix, her three sisters and her brother Ernst fell ill. Elizabeth, Alix&apos;s older sister had been sent to visit her paternal grandmother, and escaped the outbreak. Alix&apos;s mother Alice tended to the children rather than abandon them to doctors. Alice herself soon fell ill with diphtheria and died on the anniversary of her father&apos;s death, 14 December 1878, when Alix was only 6 years old. Alix, Victoria, Irene, and Ernst survived the epidemic, but Princess Mary did not.

	

Alix was married relatively late for her rank in her era, having refused a proposal from [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence]] (the eldest son of the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]]) despite strong familial pressure. It is said that Queen Victoria had wanted her two grandchildren to marry, but because she was very fond of Alix she accepted that she did not want to marry him; The Queen even went on to say that she was proud of Alix for standing up to her, something many people, including her own son the Prince of Wales did not do.

Alix however, had already met and fallen in love with [[Nicholas II of Russia|the Tsarevich of Russia]], whose mother was the sister-in-law of Alix&apos;s uncle, the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] and whose uncle [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich]] was married to Alix&apos;s sister [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna|Elizabeth]]. They were also second cousins as they were both great-grandchildren of [[Wilhelmine of Baden|Princess Wilhelmina of Baden]]. Nicholas and Alix had first met in 1884 and when Alix returned to Russia in 1889 they fell in love. &quot;It is my dream to one day marry Alix H. I have loved her for a long time, but more deeply and strongly since 1889 when she spent six weeks in Petersburg. For a long time, I have resisted my feeling that my dearest dream will come true.&quot; Nicholas wrote in his diary; and Alix reciprocated his feelings. At first, Nicholas&apos; father, [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]], refused the prospect of marriage. It was a painful evening. &quot;The Empress appeared in great distress, her eyes reddened by tears&quot; the British Ambassador informed Queen Victoria. She was hurt by their unenthusiastic reception, and declared herself to be tired of the loose morals and etiquette of the Russian court. Alexandra, in turn, was called provincial, uninteresting, and haughty.  Alexandra&apos;s failure to produce an heir to the Russian throne in her first four attempts was a source of great disappointment throughout the empire, and after she did bear a son in 1904 he was found to suffer from hemophilia.  The tsaritsa&apos;s obsessive worry over her son&apos;s health, and her determination to protect him from possible harm, thereafter isolated her from society even further.  Rather than associate with members of the highest Russian aristocracy, she sought friendships with other marginal figures such as [[Anna Vyrubova]] and the invalid Princess Sonia Obeliani.  Aristocratic ladies who were accustomed to regular invitations to Tsarskoe Selo or the Winter Palace became indignant at being ignored by the Tsar&apos;s wife, and that indignation cost the monarchy much sympathy among the class that might have offered the Tsar urgently needed support later on.

Alexandra made few attempts to forge bonds with the other members of the large Romanov family and generally attended as few court occasions as possible. She was unfavourably compared to the popular [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna]], daughter of King [[Christian IX of Denmark]] and younger sister of [[Alexandra of Denmark|the Princess of Wales]]. In Russia, dowager empresses outranked empress consorts, unlike other European royal courts, and Marie commonly insisted on exercising this privilege, which meant that she entered formal occasions first, on the Tsar&apos;s arm, while Alexandra had to follow in second place. For her part, Alexandra resented Maria&apos;s continuing influence over Nicholas, which waned only with the passage of time and the births of his children, especially Alexei, as late as 1904. Alexandra&apos;s stubbornness, moreover, did not allow her to learn from her more experienced mother-in-law who was, however, displeased with Nicholas&apos; choice of a German bride and probably would not have helped her daughter-in-law even had Alexandra sought her advice. The Dowager Empress had lived in Russia for seventeen years before coming to the throne; Alexandra had barely a month between her arrival and her marriage. Alexandra knew better than to publicly criticise &quot;Mother dear&quot;. Alexandra associated willingly only with Nicholas&apos; siblings and a very small number of the otherwise closely-knit Romanov family: Grand Duke Alexander Michailovich (husband of Nicholas&apos; sister Xenia), Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich (the most artistic of the imperial house) and his family, and Grand Duke George Michaelovich (married to Nicholas&apos; maternal first cousin, Maria of Greece).  Alexandra abhorred in particular the family of Nicholas&apos; senior uncle, Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, and his wife Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; she considered their sons, Kyrill, Boris and Andrei to be irredeemably immoral and in 1913 refused Boris&apos; proposal for the hand of Grand Duchess Olga.  Ultimately the empress&apos; attitude toward most of the Romanovs, as well as her notorious reliance on Rasputin in World War I, lost Nicholas his relatives&apos; support when the final crisis came early in 1917.  A plot among the Grand Dukes to remove Alexandra from power and exile her to the Crimea was well known in St Petersburg society in 1916, and Grand Duke Vladimir&apos;s widow Marie openly told a member of the government that the tsaritsa &quot;must be annihilated.&quot;  Had the Imperial House been willing to act in unison in 1917, the worst consequences of the Russian Revolution might have been averted; but Alexandra had proved too polarizing a figure for that to happen.

Alexandra was fiercely protective of her husband&apos;s role as Tsar, and actively supported his rights as an autocratic ruler. She was a fervent advocate of the divine right, and believed that it was unnecessary to attempt to secure the approval of the people. Her aunt,[[Victoria, Princess Royal|German Empress Frederick]], wrote to Queen Victoria that &quot;Alix is very imperious and will always insist on having her own way; she will never yield one iota of power she will imagine she wields...&quot;  Alexandra understood her second daughter, Tatiana much better. In public and in private, Tatiana surrounded her mother with unvarying attention. If a favor was needed, all the imperial children agreed that &quot;Tatiana must ask Papa to grant it.&quot;  As Olga and Tatiana grew older, they played a more serious role in public affairs. Although in private they still referred to their parents as &apos;Mama&apos; and &apos;Papa&apos; in public, they referred to &apos;the Empress&apos; and &apos;the Emperor&apos;.

Alexandra doted on Alexei. The children&apos;s tutor, [[Pierre Gilliard]] wrote, &quot;Alexei was the center of a united family, the focus of all its hopes and affections. His sisters worshiped him. He was his parents&apos; pride and joy. When he was well, the palace was transformed. Everyone and everything in it seemed bathed in sunshine.&quot;   Nicholas was not nearly as blind, but even he felt powerless to do anything about the man who seemingly saved his only son&apos;s life. One minister of Nicholas wrote, &quot; He did not like to send Rasputin away, for if Alexis died, in the eyes of the mother, he would have been the murderer of his own son.&quot;  Devastatingly, it seemed to Alexandra that God was not answering her prayers for her son&apos;s relief. Believing Alexei would die, Alexandra in desperation sent a telegram to Grigori Rasputin. Right away he sent a reply, &quot;God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much.&quot;  Alexandra had no experience of government, and constantly appointed and reappointed incompetent new ministers, which meant the government was never stable or efficient.   This was particularly dangerous in a war of attrition, as neither the troops nor the civilian population were ever adequately supplied. She paid attention to the self-serving advice of Rasputin, and their relationship was widely, though falsely, believed to be sexual in nature.  Alexandra was the focus of ever increasing  negative rumours, and widely believed to be a German spy in the Russian court.

[[World War I]] put what proved to be unbearable burden on Imperial Russia&apos;s government and economy, both of which were dangerously weak. Mass shortages and hunger became the daily situation for tens of millions of Russians due to the disruptions of the [[war economy]]. Fifteen million men were diverted from agricultural production to fight in the war, and the transportation infrastructure (primarily railroads) were diverted towards war use, exacerbating food shortages in the cities as available agricultural products could not be brought to urban areas. Inflation was rampant which, combined with the food shortages and the poor performance by the Russian military in the war, generated a great deal of anger and unrest among the people in [[Saint Petersburg]] and other cities.

The decision of the Tsar to take personal command of the military against advice was disastrous as he was directly blamed for all losses. His relocation to the front, leaving the [[Tsaritsa]] in charge of the government, helped undermine the Romanov dynasty. The poor performance of the military led to rumours believed by the people that the German-born Tsaritsa was part of a conspiracy to help Germany win the war. The severe winter of 1916â€“17 essentially doomed Imperial Russia. Food shortages worsened and [[famine]] gripped the cities. The mismanagement and failures of the war turned the soldiers against the Tsar. .  The mood of the army is perhaps captured well by one scene in [[Jean Renoir]]&apos;s movie, [[La Grande Illusion]]. Alexandra sends boxes to Russian prisoners of war. Thrilled to think they are receiving [[vodka]], they open them to discover bibles, and promptly riot.

By March  1917, conditions had worsened. Steelworkers went out on strike on 7 March, and the following day, [[International Womenâ€™s Day]], crowds hungry for bread began rioting on the streets of Saint Petersburg to protest food shortages and the war. After two days of rioting, the Tsar ordered the Army to restore order and on 11 March they fired on the crowd. That very same day, the [[Duma]], the elected legislature, urged the Tsar to take action to ameliorate the concerns of the people. The Tsar responded by dissolving the Duma.

On 12 March soldiers sent to suppress the rioting crowds mutinied and joined the rebellion, thus providing the spark to ignite the February Revolution (like the later October Revolution of November 1917, the Russian Revolutions of 1917 get their names due to the Old Style calendar). Soldiers and workers set up the &quot;[[Petrograd Soviet]]&quot; of 2,500 elected deputies while the Duma declared a Provisional Government on 13 March. [[Alexander Kerensky]] was a key player in the new regime. The Duma informed the Tsar that day that he must abdicate.

In an effort to put an end to the uprising in the capital, Nicholas tried to get to Saint Petersburg by train from army headquarters at Mogiliev. The route was blocked so he tried another way. His train was stopped at Pskov where, after receiving advice from his generals, he first abdicated the throne for himself and later, on seeking medical advice, for himself and his son the [[Tsarevich]] [[Alexei]]. Alexandra was now in a perilous position as the wife of the deposed Tsar, hated by the Russian people. Nicholas finally was allowed to return to the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo where he was placed under arrest with his family. Despite the fact he was a first cousin of both Nicholas and Alexandra, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] refused to allow them to evacuate to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], as he was alarmed by their unpopularity in his country and the potential repercussions to his own throne.

The [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] formed after the revolution kept Nicholas, Alexandra, and their children confined in their primary residence, the [[Alexander Palace]] at [[Tsarskoye Selo]], until they were moved to [[Tobolsk]] in [[Siberia]] in August 1917, a step by the [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] government designed to remove them from the capital and possible harm. From Tobolsk, Alexandra managed to send a letter to sister-in-law, [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia Alexandrovna]], in the [[Crimea]],

&quot;My darling Xenia,
My thoughts are with you, how magically good and beautiful everything must be with you â€“ you are the flowers. But it is indescribably painful for the kind motherland, I cannot explain. I am glad for you that you are finally with all your family as you have been apart. I would like to see Olga in all her new big happiness. Everybody is healthy, but myself, during the last 6 weeks I experience nerve pains in my face with toothache. Very tormenting ...

We live quietly, have established ourselves well [in Tobolsk] although it is far, far away from everybody, But God is merciful. He gives us strength and consolation ....&quot; 

Alexandra and her family remained in Tobolsk until after the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] in November 1917, but were subsequently moved to Bolshevik controlled [[Yekaterinburg]] in 1918. Nicholas was ordered to Ekaterinburg. Alexandra and their daughter Maria went with him arriving at the [[Ipatiev]] House on 30 April 1918. On entering their new prison, they were ordered to open all their luggage. Alexandra immediately objected. Nicholas tried to come to her defence saying, &quot;So far we have had polite treatment and men who were gentlemen but now -&quot;  The former Tsar was quickly cut off. The guards informed him he was no longer at Tsarskoe Selo and that refusal to comply with their request would result in his removal from the rest of his family; a second offence would be rewarded with hard labour, Fearing for her husband&apos;s safety, Alexandra quickly gave in and allowed the search. On the window frame of what was to be her last bedroom in the Ipatiev House, Alexandra scrawled a [[swastika]], her favourite good luck symbol, and pencilled the date 17/30 April 1918. The Ekaterinburg region&apos;s chief forensic expert said, &quot;Tests conducted in Yekaterinburg and Moscow allowed DNA to be extracted from the bones, which proved positive,&quot; Nikolai Nevolin said. &quot;Once the genetic analysis has been completed in Russia, its results will be compared with test results from foreign experts.&quot;  Nevolin said the final results would be published in April or May 2008. Certainty about the remains will finally put an end to the story of Anna Anderson having any connection with the Romanovs as all remaining bodies will be accounted for.

DNA analysis represented a key means of identifying the bodies. A blood sample from [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] (a grandson of Alexandra&apos;s oldest sister, [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine]]) was employed to identify Alexandra and her daughters through their [[mitochondrial DNA]]. They belonged to [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)]]. Nicholas was identified from DNA obtained from among others his late brother [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia]]. Grand Duke George had died of [[tuberculosis]] in the late 1890s and was buried in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St.Petersburg.

Alexandra, Nicholas and three daughters were reinterred in the St.Catherine Chapel of the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] at the Fortress of St.Peter and St.Paul in St.Petersburg in 1998, with much ceremony, on the eightieth anniversary of the execution.

In 2000 Alexandra was [[canonisation|canonised]] by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] together with her husband Nicholas II, their children and others including her sister Grand Duchess Elizabeth and her fellow nun Varvara.

A rather romanticised version of Alexandra&apos;s life was dramatised in the 1971 movie [[Nicholas and Alexandra]], based on the book by the same title written by [[Robert Massie]], in which the tsaritsa was played by [[Janet Suzman]].
