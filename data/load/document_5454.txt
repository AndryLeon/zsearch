This article is about the music genre. For other uses, see [[Heavy metal]] and [[Metal (disambiguation)]].

Heavy metal (often referred to simply as metal) is a genre of [[rock music]] that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in [[blues-rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]], the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified [[Distortion (guitar)|distortion]], extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are generally associated with masculinity and [[machismo]].

The first heavy metal bands such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Deep Purple]] attracted large audiences, though they were often critically reviled, a status common throughout the history of the genre. In the mid-1970s [[Judas Priest]] helped spur the genre&apos;s evolution by discarding much of its [[blues]] influence; [[Motörhead]] introduced a [[punk rock]] sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Bands in the [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]] such as [[Iron Maiden]] followed in a similar vein. Before the end of the decade, heavy metal had attracted a worldwide following of fans known as &quot;[[metalhead]]s&quot; or &quot;[[headbanging|headbangers]]&quot;.

In the 1980s, [[glam metal]] became a major commercial force with groups like [[Mötley Crüe]]. [[Underground music|Underground scenes]] produced an array of more extreme, aggressive styles: [[thrash metal]] broke into the mainstream with bands such as [[Metallica]], while other styles like [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] remain [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomena. Since the mid-1990s, popular styles such as [[nu metal]], which often incorporates elements of [[funk]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]; and [[metalcore]], which blends [[extreme metal]] with [[hardcore punk]], have further expanded the definition of the genre.

Heavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound, and vigorous vocals. Metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter, or omit one or more of these attributes. [[New York Times]] critic [[Jon Pareles]] writes, &quot;In the taxonomy of popular music, heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard-rock—the breed with less syncopation, less blues, more showmanship and more brute force.&quot; The typical band lineup includes a [[drummer]], a [[bass guitar|bassist]], a [[rhythm guitar]]ist, a [[lead guitar]]ist, and a singer, who may or may not be an instrumentalist. [[Keyboard instruments]] are sometimes used to enhance the fullness of the sound.

The [[electric guitar]] and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal. The lead role of the guitar in heavy metal often collides with the traditional &quot;frontman&quot; or bandleader role of the vocalist, creating a musical tension as the two &quot;contend for dominance&quot; in a spirit of &quot;affectionate rivalry&quot;. Metal basslines vary widely in complexity, from holding down a low [[pedal point]] as a foundation to doubling complex riffs and [[lick (music)|lick]]s along with the lead and/or rhythm guitars. Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica&apos;s [[Cliff Burton]] in the early 1980s.

The essence of metal drumming is creating a loud, constant beat for the band using the &quot;trifecta of speed, power, and precision&quot;. Metal drumming &quot;requires an exceptional amount of endurance&quot;, and drummers have to develop &quot;considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity...to play the intricate patterns&quot; used in metal. A characteristic metal drumming technique is the [[cymbal choke]], which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it with the other hand (or, in some cases, the same striking hand), producing a burst of sound. The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music. A 1977 review of a Motörhead concert noted how &quot;excessive volume in particular figured into the band’s impact.&quot; Weinstein makes the case that in the same way that [[melody]] is the main element of [[Pop music|pop]] and rhythm is the main focus of [[house (music)|house]] music, powerful sound, timbre, and volume are the key elements of metal. She argues that the loudness is designed to &quot;sweep the listener into the sound&quot; and to provide a &quot;shot of youthful vitality.&quot; The tritone, an interval spanning three whole tones—such as C and F#—was a forbidden dissonance in medieval ecclesiastical singing, which led monks to call it diabolus in musica—&quot;the devil in music.&quot; Because of that original symbolic association, it came to be heard in Western cultural convention as &quot;evil&quot;. Heavy metal has made extensive use of the tritone in guitar solos and riffs, such as in the beginning of &quot;[[Black Sabbath (song)|Black Sabbath]]&quot;.

Heavy metal songs often make extensive use of [[pedal point]] as a harmonic basis. A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign (i.e., dissonant) harmony is sounded in the other parts.

[[Robert Walser (musicologist)|Robert Walser]] argues that, alongside blues and R&amp;B, the &quot;assemblage of disparate musical styles known...as &apos;classical music&apos;&quot; has been a major influence on heavy metal since the genre&apos;s earliest days. He claims that metal&apos;s &quot;most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music. Their appropriation and adaptation of classical models sparked the development of a new kind of guitar virtuosity [and] changes in the harmonic and melodic language of heavy metal.&quot;

Although a number of metal musicians cite classical composers as inspiration, classical and metal are rooted in different cultural traditions and practices—classical in the [[art music]] tradition, metal in the [[popular music]] tradition. As musicologists Nicolas Cook and Nicola Dibben note, &quot;Analyses of popular music also sometimes reveal the influence of &apos;art traditions.&apos; An example is Walser’s linkage of heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century Romanticism. However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from &apos;art music.&apos;&quot;

Black Sabbath and the many metal bands they inspired have concentrated lyrically &quot;on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music,&quot; according to scholars David Hatch and Stephen Millward. They take as an example Sabbath&apos;s 1970 album [[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]], which &quot;included songs dealing with personal trauma—&apos;[[Paranoid (song)|Paranoid]]&apos; and &apos;[[Fairies Wear Boots]]&apos; (which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking)—as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory &apos;[[War Pigs (song)|War Pigs]]&apos; and &apos;[[Hand of Doom (song)|Hand of Doom]].&apos;&quot; Nuclear annihilation was addressed in later metal songs such as Iron Maiden&apos;s &quot;[[2 Minutes to Midnight]]&quot; and [[Ozzy Osbourne]]&apos;s &quot;Killer of Giants&quot;. Death is a predominant theme in heavy metal, routinely featuring in the lyrics of bands as otherwise widely different as [[Slayer]] and [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] The more extreme forms of death metal and grindcore tend to have aggressive and gory lyrics.

Deriving from the genre&apos;s roots in blues music, sex is another important topic—a thread running from Led Zeppelin&apos;s suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam and nu metal bands. Romantic tragedy is a standard theme of gothic and doom metal, as well as of nu metal, where teenage angst is another central topic. Heavy metal songs often feature outlandish, fantasy-inspired lyrics, lending them an escapist quality. Iron Maiden&apos;s songs, for instance, were frequently inspired by mythology, fiction, and poetry, such as &quot;[[Rime of the Ancient Mariner (song)|Rime of the Ancient Mariner]],&quot; based on the [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] [[Rime of the Ancient Mariner|poem]]. Other examples include Black Sabbath&apos;s &quot;The Wizard,&quot; [[Megadeth]]&apos;s &quot;The Conjuring&quot; and &quot;Five Magics,&quot; and Judas Priest&apos;s &quot;Dreamer Deceiver&quot;. Since the 1980s, with the rise of thrash metal and songs such as Metallica&apos;s &quot;[[...And Justice for All (song)|...And Justice for All]]&quot; and Megadeth&apos;s &quot;[[Peace Sells]]&quot;, more metal lyrics have included sociopolitical commentary. Genres such as melodic death metal, progressive metal, and black metal often explore philosophical themes.

The thematic content of heavy metal has long been a target of criticism. According to Jon Pareles, &quot;Heavy metal&apos;s main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates...a party without limits.... [T]he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic.&quot; Many metal performers of the 1970s and 1980s used radically shaped and brightly colored instruments to enhance their stage appearance. Fashion and personal style was especially important for glam metal bands of the era. Performers typically wore long, dyed, hairspray-teased hair (hence the nickname, &quot;hair metal&quot;); makeup such as lipstick and eyeliner; gaudy clothing, including leopard-skin-printed shirts or vests and tight denim, leather, or spandex pants; and accessories such as headbands and jewelry. Pioneered by the heavy metal act [[X Japan]] in the late 1980s, bands in the Japanese movement known as [[visual kei]]—which includes many nonmetal groups—emphasize elaborate costumes, hair, and makeup.

Many metal musicians when performing live engage in [[headbanging]], which involves rhythmically beating time with the head, often emphasized by long hair. The [[corna]], or devil horns, hand gesture, also widespread, was popularized by vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]] while with Black Sabbath and [[Dio (band)|Dio]]. This code puts several demands on performers: they must appear both completely devoted to their music and loyal to the subculture that supports it; they must appear disinterested in mainstream appeal and radio hits; and they must never &quot;sell out&quot;. For the fans themselves, the code promotes &quot;opposition to established authority, and separateness from the rest of society.&quot; Scholars of metal have noted the tendency of fans to classify and reject some performers (and some other fans) as &quot;[[poseur (music)|poseur]]s&quot; &quot;who pretended to be part of the subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity.&quot; Vocalists similarly modified their technique and increased their reliance on amplification, often becoming more stylized and dramatic. In terms of sheer volume, especially in live performance, The Who&apos;s &quot;bigger-louder-wall-of-[[Marshall Amplification#Marshall Stack|Marshall]]s&quot; approach was seminal. Simultaneous advances in amplification and recording technology made it possible to successfully capture the power of this heavier approach on record.

The combination of blues-rock with psychedelic rock formed much of the original basis for heavy metal. One of the most influential bands in forging the merger of genres was the British power trio [[Cream (band)|Cream]], who derived a massive, heavy sound from [[unison]] riffing between guitarist [[Eric Clapton]] and bassist [[Jack Bruce]], as well as [[Ginger Baker]]&apos;s double bass drumming. Their first two LPs, [[Fresh Cream]] (1966) and [[Disraeli Gears]] (1967), are regarded as essential prototypes for the future style. The Jimi Hendrix Experience&apos;s debut album, [[Are You Experienced (album)|Are You Experienced]] (1967), was also highly influential. Hendrix&apos;s virtuosic technique would be emulated by many metal guitarists and the album&apos;s most successful single, &quot;[[Purple Haze]],&quot; is identified by some as the first heavy metal hit. but the main offense was its perceived musical and lyrical vacuity: reviewing a Black Sabbath album in the early 1970s, leading critic [[Robert Christgau]] described it as &quot;dull and decadent...dim-witted, amoral exploitation.&quot;

[[Punk rock]] emerged in the mid-1970s as a reaction against contemporary social conditions as well as what was perceived as the overindulgent, overproduced rock music of the time, including heavy metal. Sales of heavy metal records declined sharply in the late 1970s in the face of punk, [[disco]], and more mainstream rock.

Many [[List of heavy metal genres|subgenres of heavy metal]] developed outside of the commercial mainstream during the 1980s. Several attempts have been made to map the complex world of underground metal, most notably by the editors of [[Allmusic]], as well as critic [[Rockdetector|Garry Sharpe-Young]]. Sharpe-Young&apos;s multivolume metal encyclopedia separates the underground into five major categories: [[thrash metal]], [[death metal]], [[black metal]], [[power metal]], and the related subgenres of [[doom metal|doom]] and [[gothic metal]].

Thrash metal emerged in the early 1980s under the influence of [[hardcore punk]] and the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, particularly songs in the revved-up style known as [[speed metal]]. The movement began in the United States, with [[Bay Area thrash metal]] being the leading scene. The sound developed by thrash groups was faster and more aggressive than that of the original metal bands and their glam metal successors. Two decades later, [[Metal Hammer]] named it the best album of the preceding twenty years. Slayer attracted a following among far-right skinheads, and accusations of promoting violence and Nazi themes have dogged the band. In the early 1990s, thrash achieved breakout success, challenging and redefining the metal mainstream. Metallica&apos;s [[Metallica (album)|self-titled 1991 album]] topped the Billboard chart, Megadeth&apos;s [[Countdown to Extinction]] (1992) hit number 2, Anthrax and Slayer cracked the top 10, and albums by regional bands such as Testament and Sepultura entered the top 100.

Thrash soon began to evolve and split into more extreme metal genres. &quot;Slayer&apos;s music was directly responsible for the rise of death metal,&quot; according to MTV News. The NWOBHM band Venom was also an important progenitor. The death metal movement in both North America and Europe adopted and emphasized the elements of [[blasphemy]] and [[diabolism]] employed by such acts. Florida&apos;s [[Death (band)|Death]] and the Bay Area&apos;s [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]] are recognized as seminal bands in the style. Both groups have been credited with inspiring the subgenre&apos;s name, the latter via its 1984 demo Death Metal and the song &quot;Death Metal,&quot; from its 1985 debut album [[Seven Churches (album)|Seven Churches]] (1985).

Death metal utilizes the speed and aggression of both thrash and hardcore, fused with lyrics preoccupied with [[Z movie|Z-grade]] [[slasher film|slasher movie]] violence and [[Satanism]]. Death metal vocals are typically bleak, involving guttural &quot;[[death growl]]s,&quot; high-pitched [[screaming (music)|screaming]], the &quot;death rasp,&quot; and other uncommon techniques. Complementing the deep, aggressive vocal style are downtuned, highly [[distortion (guitar)|distorted]] guitars One major exception to this rule was [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]]&apos;s [[Glen Benton]], who branded an inverted cross on his forehead and wore armor on stage. [[Morbid Angel]] adopted [[neo-fascist]] imagery.

By 1990, Mayhem was regularly wearing [[corpsepaint]]; many other black metal acts also adopted the look. Bathory inspired the [[Viking metal]] and [[folk metal]] movements and [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]] brought blast beats to the fore. Some bands in the Scandinavian black metal scene became associated with considerable violence in the early 1990s, with Mayhem and Burzum linked to church burnings. Growing commercial hype around death metal generated a backlash; beginning in Norway, much of the Scandinavian metal underground shifted to support a black metal scene that resisted being co-opted by the commercial metal industry. According to former [[Gorgoroth]] vocalist [[Gaahl]], &quot;Black Metal was never meant to reach an audience.... [We] had a common enemy which was, of course, Christianity, socialism and everything that democracy stands for.&quot; Though a relatively underground style in North America, it enjoys wide popularity in Europe, Japan, and South America. Power metal focuses on upbeat, epic melodies and themes that &quot;appeal to the listener&apos;s sense of valor and loveliness.&quot; The prototype for the sound was established in the mid- to late 1980s by Germany&apos;s [[Helloween]], which combined the power riffs, melodic approach, and high-pitched, &quot;clean&quot; singing style of bands like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden with thrash&apos;s speed and energy, &quot;crystalliz[ing] the sonic ingredients of what is now known as power metal.&quot; New York&apos;s [[Manowar (band)|Manowar]] and [[Virgin Steele]] were pioneering American bands. [[Yngwie J. Malmsteen]]&apos;s [[Rising Force]] (1984) was crucial in popularizing the ultrafast electric guitar style known as &quot;[[shred guitar|shredding]]&quot; as well as the merger of metal with [[neo-classical metal|classical music elements]], developments that have strongly influenced power metal.

Traditional power metal bands like Sweden&apos;s [[HammerFall]], England&apos;s [[DragonForce]], and Florida&apos;s [[Iced Earth]] have a sound clearly indebted to the classic NWOBHM style. Many power metal bands such as Florida&apos;s [[Kamelot]], Finland&apos;s [[Nightwish]], Italy&apos;s [[Rhapsody of Fire]], and Russia&apos;s [[Catharsis (Russian band)|Catharsis]] feature a keyboard-based [[Symphonic metal#Symphonic power metal|&quot;symphonic&quot; sound]], sometimes employing orchestras and opera singers. Power metal has built a strong fanbase in Japan and South America, where bands like Brazil&apos;s [[Angra (band)|Angra]] and Argentina&apos;s [[Rata Blanca]] are popular.

Closely related to power metal is [[progressive metal]], which adopts the complex compositional approach of bands like [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[King Crimson]]. This style emerged in the United States in the early and mid-1980s, with innovators such as [[Queensrÿche]], [[Fates Warning]], and [[Dream Theater]]. The mix of the progressive and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey&apos;s [[Symphony X]], whose guitarist [[Michael Romeo]] is among the most recognized of latter-day shredders. Bands such as Sweden&apos;s [[Meshuggah]] have taken progressive in even more experimental directions as part of the [[avant-garde metal]] movement.

Emerging in the mid-1980s with such bands as California&apos;s [[Saint Vitus (band)|Saint Vitus]], Maryland&apos;s [[The Obsessed]], Chicago&apos;s [[Trouble (band)|Trouble]], and Sweden&apos;s [[Candlemass]], the doom metal movement rejected other metal styles&apos; emphasis on speed, slowing its music to a crawl. Doom metal traces its roots to the lyrical themes and musical approach of early Black Sabbath and Sabbath contemporaries such as [[Blue Cheer]], [[Pentagram (band)|Pentagram]], and [[Black Widow (band)|Black Widow]]. The [[Melvins]] have also been a significant influence on doom metal and a number of its subgenres. Doom emphasizes melody, melancholy tempos, and a sepulchral mood relative to many other varieties of metal.

The 1991 release of [[Forest of Equilibrium]], the debut album by UK band [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]], helped spark a new wave of doom metal. During the same period, the doom-death fusion style of British bands [[Paradise Lost (band)|Paradise Lost]], [[My Dying Bride]], and [[Anathema (band)|Anathema]] gave rise to European gothic metal, with its signature dual-vocalist arrangements, exemplified by Norway&apos;s [[Theatre of Tragedy]] and [[Tristania (band)|Tristania]]. New York&apos;s [[Type O Negative]] introduced an American take on the style. Led by the Swedish band [[Therion (band)|Therion]]&apos;s incorporation of classical elements, gothic metal in turn spawned a [[symphonic metal]] movement including Australia&apos;s [[Virgin Black]], Finland&apos;s [[Nightwish]], and the Netherlands&apos; [[Within Temptation]] and [[After Forever]].

In the United States, [[sludge metal]], mixing doom and hardcore, emerged in the late 1980s—[[Eyehategod]] and [[Crowbar (US band)|Crowbar]] were leaders in a [[Music of New Orleans#Heavy metal|major Louisiana sludge scene]]. Early in the next decade, California&apos;s [[Kyuss]] and [[Sleep (band)|Sleep]], inspired by the earlier doom metal bands, spearheaded the rise of [[stoner metal]], while Seattle&apos;s [[Earth (band)|Earth]] helped develop the [[drone metal]] subgenre. The late 1990s saw new bands form such as the Los Angeles–based [[Goatsnake]], with a classic stoner/doom sound, and [[Sunn O)))]], which crosses lines between doom, drone, and [[dark ambient]] metal—the New York Times has compared their sound to an &quot;Indian raga in the middle of an earthquake&quot;. Bands in Seattle&apos;s grunge scene such as [[Soundgarden]], credited as making a &quot;place for heavy metal in alternative rock&quot;, and [[Alice in Chains]] were at the center of the alternative metal movement. The label was applied to a wide spectrum of other acts that fused metal with different styles: [[Faith No More]] combined their alternative rock sound with punk, [[funk]], metal, and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]; [[Primus (band)|Primus]] joined elements of funk, punk, [[thrash metal]], and [[experimental music]]; [[Tool (band)|Tool]] mixed metal and [[progressive rock]]; bands such as [[Fear Factory]] and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] began incorporating metal into their [[industrial music|industrial sound]], and vice versa, respectively; and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] went down a similar route, while also employing shock effects of the sort popularized by Alice Cooper. Alternative metal artists, though they did not represent a cohesive scene, were united by their willingness to experiment with the metal genre and their rejection of glam metal aesthetics (with the stagecraft of Marilyn Manson and White Zombie—also identified with alt-metal—significant, if partial, exceptions). and Australia&apos;s [[Wolfmother]]. The Darkness&apos;s [[Permission to Land]] (2003), described as an &quot;eerily realistic simulation of &apos;80s metal and &apos;70s glam,&quot; The Swedish melodic death metal act [[In Flames]] took both [[Come Clarity]] (2006) and [[A Sense of Purpose]] (2008) to number 6 in Germany; each album topped the Swedish charts. Recently the [[Brit Award]] for best live band was given to [[Iron Maiden]], the first time any metal band ever won a Brit Award.
