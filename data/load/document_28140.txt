Founded on August 2, 1940, it currently plays in [[Segunda División|the second division]],  after finishing 15th in the [[Segunda División 2008-09|2008-09]] campaign. 

The club was founded in 1940, under the name Albacete Fútbol Asociación,  being later changed in an attempt to make it sound &quot;more Spanish&quot;.

In 1989, [[Benito Floro Sanz|Benito Floro]] consecutively promoted it from [[Segunda División B|the third]] to [[La Liga|the first division]], overachieving for a seventh place in [[La Liga 1991-92|the league]]. Floro would later coach [[Real Madrid]], returning to Alba two seasons later, as the club were relegated in [[La Liga 1995-96|1995-96]].

After years in the second division facing serious economic and sporting difficulties, Albacete returned to the topflight in [[Segunda División 2002-03|2002-03]], led by César Ferrando (later of [[Atlético de Madrid]]). However, it dropped in [[La Liga 2004-05|2004-05]], after just six wins from 38 matches, going on to stabilize in the subsequent seasons in the second level.
