The city of Dover is the capital and second largest city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Delaware]]. It is also the county seat of [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]], and the principal city of the Dover, Delaware [[Dover metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] which encompasses all of Kent County. It is located on the [[St. Jones River]] in the [[Delaware River]] coastal plain. It was named by [[William Penn]] for [[Dover]] in [[Kent]], [[England]]. As of 2007, the city had an estimated population of 35,811.

Dover was founded as the court town for newly established [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]] in 1683 by [[William Penn]], the Proprietor of the territory generally known as the &quot;[[Lower Counties]] on the Delaware.&quot; Later, in 1717, the city was officially laid out by a special commission of the [[Delaware General Assembly]]. The capital of the state of [[Delaware]] was moved here from [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]] in 1777 due to its central location and relative safety from British raiders on the [[Delaware River]]. The city&apos;s central square, known as The Green, was the location of many rallies, troop reviews, and other patriotic events. To this day, The Green remains the heart of Dover&apos;s historic district and is the location of the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] and the Kent County Courthouse.

Dover was most famously the home of [[Caesar Rodney]], the popular wartime leader of Delaware during the [[American Revolution]]. He is known to have been buried outside Dover, but the precise location of his grave is unknown. A [[cenotaph]] in his honor is erected in the cemetery of the Christ Episcopal Church on The Green in Dover.

Dover and Kent County were deeply divided over the issue of [[slavery]] and was a &quot;stop&quot; on the [[Underground Railroad]], due to its proximity to slave holding [[Maryland]] and free [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New Jersey]]. It was also home to a large [[Quaker]] community that encouraged a sustained emancipation effort in the early nineteenth century. There were very few slaves in the area, but the institution was supported, if not practiced, by a small majority, who saw to its continuation.

Delaware&apos;s largest employer is also Dover&apos;s – the state government. A large portion, but not all, of the state&apos;s bureaucracy is located in and around Dover. However, like some other American states, Delaware&apos;s capital is not its largest city. Consequently, [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], in the northern part of the state and its largest city, has many state offices and employees one would normally expect to find in the state capital, including the headquarters of the Office of the [[Delaware Attorney General|Attorney General]].

Dover is one of the fast-growing areas in the State of Delaware, due in large part to the relatively low cost of living. As a consequence, the Kent County government is a major employer in the area as well. Apart from the state and county governments, Dover&apos;s significant employers include [[Dover Air Force Base]], located within the southeast corporate limits of the city. The base houses two airlift wings as well as the U.S. military&apos;s only [[mortuary]] located in the continental United States, which accepts and processes the remains of soldiers killed in battle. In addition, the [[Playtex]] corporation, [[General Mills]] and [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] have manufacturing facilities in Dover. [[ILC Dover]], in nearby Frederica, is the producer of fabrics for military and aerospace uses, along with being the primary contractor for production of the [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Skylab]] spacesuits, as well as the spacesuit assembly for the [[Space Shuttle]]&apos;s [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit]] (EMU).

Two weekends a year, [[NASCAR]] stock car races are held at [[Dover International Speedway]], attracting over 100,000 spectators and visitors and temporarily making Dover the state&apos;s largest city.

An alternate route of U.S. Route 13, [[U.S. Route 13 Alternate (Dover, Delaware)|U.S. Route 13 Alternate]], passes through downtown Dover on Governors Avenue.
