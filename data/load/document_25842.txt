The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) (est. 1975) () is a Kurdish [[political party]] in [[Iraq]].

The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) was founded in June 1975, by coordinations between [[Jalal Talabani]] and [[Nawshirwan Mustafa]]. Mr. Mustafa was the leader of an independent socialist movement that adopted Kurdish nationalism called &quot;Komeley Renjderan,&quot; some two months after the collapse of the Kurdish rebellion of 1974-1975. Created at a moment of profound crisis for the Kurdish people in Iraq, the organization&apos;s aim was to revitalize resistance and to rebuild and redirect Kurdish society along modern and democratic lines. Jalal Talabani, a former student leader, lawyer, journalist and resistance leader, has been the Secretary General of the PUK since its founding in 1975

The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan claims to be working for [[self-determination]], [[human rights]], [[democracy]] and peace for the [[Kurdish people]] of Iraq.

The Secretary General is [[Jalal Talabani]], the current president of Iraq. The current Deputy Secretary General is Kosrat Rasool Ali. The PUK&apos;s policy and decision making is issued mainly by [[Talabani]].

PUK&apos;s decision-making is centralized around [[Talabani]] mainly. The Leadership Council elects the Secretary General and the 11 member Political Bureau. The PUK was originally formed as an umbrella organization unifying various trends within the Kurdish political movement in Iraq. In 1992, the constituent groupings within the PUK merged into a unified political movement that affirmed its social-democratic identity and affiliation. The PUK has branches in all of the major cities and towns of Iraqi Kurdistan and draws membership from a broad cross-section of Kurdish society. The membership of the PUK, based on statistics compiled in September 1998, stands at 800,280 members and associates. The PUK contested the 1992 elections for the Kurdistan National Assembly, and the party list acquired 423,682 votes of the total of 957,469 valid votes cast - giving the PUK commanding majority in three of Iraqi Kurdistan four governorates.

PUK&apos;s organizational structure includes:

Bureau for Organization: Manages PUK&apos;s organizations throughout the region, as well as producing and disseminating educational and informational materials for distribution to the membership. The bureau also supervises the electoral process within the organization and ensures that the party adheres to its bylaws.

- The People of Kurdistan TV (based in Sulaymaniah), the main television station, and other smaller TV stations in the towns and districts of the region;

The bureau acts as a liaison with local human rights organizations and engages in a wide range of educational campaigns with regard to human rights principles, the rule of law, and democracy and to ensure PUK&apos;s adherence to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The bureau reports directly to the PUK Secretary General.

In addition an other son of Talabani,&apos;Pavail&quot; is heading the anti-terror units of Sulaymaniyah that is functioning without any obligation to the rule of law. More than five people were announced to be arrested by Talabani&apos;s son for five years and they have yet to receive any trial.

The PUK was a coalition of five separate political entities that united under the leadership of  Jalal Talabani and [[Nawshirwan Mustafa]]; the leading factions were Komala Ranjdarani Kurdistan (&quot;The League&quot;) and Shorish Geran (&quot;revolution spreaders&quot;).

The PUK received grassroots support from the urban intellectual classes of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] upon its establishment, this was partly due to 13 of its 15 founding members being PhD holders and academics. In the early 1980s the PUK evolved and broadened its appeal to all sections of Kurdish society especially the rural classes. The regional Kurdish assembly elections showed that the PUK&apos;s support lies predominantly in the southern area of Iraqi Kurdistan. Since the first [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], the PUK has jointly administered [[Kurdish Autonomous Region|northern Iraqi Kurdistan]] with the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq|Kurdistan Democratic Party]] (KDP). However, cooperation with the KDP in administering the area is not  smooth,violence flared up between KDP and PUK [[militia]]s. Effectively the areas was divided into KDP-controlled territory and PUK-controlled territory (centered around Sulaymaniah).

The PUK joined with the KDP and smaller parties to form the [[Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan]] as an umbrella group contesting the [[Iraqi National Assembly election, 2005]]. This unified Kurdish list gained 25.6% of the vote on the first post-Saddam Iraqi elections on 31 January 2005. Jalal Talabani is now the president of the republic of Iraq.

This was followed by the decision in January 2006, to form an alliance with the KDP and run [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] under a unified administration. PUK joined PDK in the recent elections held in Kurdistan to elect a new [[president]] and [[parliament]].

The PUK lost its stronghold city, Sulaymaniyah in the Iraqi Kurdistan legislative election of 2009. The main reason is believed by observers to be because of the widespread corruption inside the structure of PUK, and centralization of decision making. The formation of a new list, Gorran, that was formed by [[Nawshirwan Mustafa]] won the majority of the votes in Sulaymaniyah. Observers say that PUK is going through a very critical phase that was admitted by its officials, including the head of PUK&apos;s media bureaus. PUK has lost many of its supporters inside and outside of Kurdistan and is expected to lose the position of its secretary general of Iraq&apos;s presidency. PUK began taking measures and punishing employees they suspected were sympathetic to the opposition (Change list) ahead of an historic parliamentary election in July.. The measures include sacking and dismissing more than 2000 people of government positions, psychological pressures and accusations that they would be prosecuted for corruption charges, and taking away all the social privileges. Hundreds rallied in Sulaymaniyah condemning the measures of PUK and in 11/10/2009 a major rally was set in front of the office of the British prime minister also condemning the PUK and PDK measures against their political rivals. More than 500 people attended.
