Bolesław III Wrymouth (; b. [[20 August]] [[1086]] – d. [[28 October]] [[1138]]), Duke of [[Poland]] from 1102 until 1138. He was the only child of Duke [[Władysław I Herman]] and his first wife [[Judith of Bohemia|Judith]], daughter of [[Vratislaus II of Bohemia]]. 

Bolesław spent his early adulthood fighting his older half-brother [[Zbigniew]] for domination  and most of his rule attending to the policy of unification of Polish lands and maintaining full sovereignty of the Polish state in the face of constant threat from expansionist eastern policy of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and her allies, most notably [[Bohemia]]. Boleslaw III, like [[Boleslaw II the Bold]], based his foreign policy on maintaining good relations with neighboring [[Hungary]] and [[Kievan Rus]], with whom he forged strong links through marriage and military cooperation. Another foreign policy goal was the gain and [[conversion of Pomerania]], which he accomplished by adding most of [[Pomerania]] to his domains by 1102-1122. Boleslaw III also upheld the independence of the Polish [[archbishopric of Gniezno]]. He strengthened the international position of Poland by his victory over the German Empire in the Polish-German War of 1109. He was also able to enlarge the country&apos;s territory.  Despite undoubted successes, Bolesław III Wrymouth  has committed serious political errors, such as the crime committed against [[Zbigniew of Poland|Zbigniew]]. The crime against his half-brother and his penance for it show Bolesław’s great ambition as well as his ability to find political compromise. His last, and perhaps the most momentous act, was his will and testament known as &quot;The Succession Statute&quot; in which he divided the country among his sons, leading to almost 200 years of feudal fragmentation of the Polish Kingdom. Nevertheless, Bolesław became a symbol of  Polish political aspirations until well into 19th century.

In 1086 the coronation of [[Vratislaus II of Bohemia|Vratislav II]] as King of [[Bohemia]] and his alignment with [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|László I]], King of [[Hungary]], threatened the position of the Polish ruler, Duke [[Władysław I Herman]]. Therefore that same year Władysław I was forced to recall from Hungarian banishment the only son of [[Bolesław II the Bold]] and a rightful heir to the Polish throne, [[Mieszko Bolesławowic]]. Upon his return young [[Mieszko Bolesławowic|Boleslawowic]] accepted the over-lordship of his uncle and gave up his hereditary claim to the crown of Poland in exchange for becoming first in line to succeed him. In return, Duke Wladyslaw I Herman granted his nephew the district of [[Kraków]]. The situation was further complicated for Władysław I Herman by a lack of a legitimate male heir, as his first-born son [[Zbigniew of Poland|Zbigniew]] came from a union not recognized by the church. With the return of [[Mieszko Bolesławowic]] to Poland, Władysław I normalized his relations with the kingdom of Hungary as well as Kievan Rus  (the marriage of Mieszko Boleslawowic to a Kievan princess was arranged in 1088). These actions allowed Herman to strengthen his authority and alleviate further tensions in the international affairs. 

Lack of a legitimate heir, however, remained a concern for Władysław I and in 1085 he and his wife [[Judith of Bohemia]] sent rich gifts, among which was a life size statue of a child made of gold, to the [[Benedictine]] Sanctuary of [[Saint Giles]] in [[Saint-Gilles, Gard|Saint-Gilles]], [[Provance]] begging for offspring. The Polish envoys were led by the personal chaplain of Duchess Judith, Piotr. 

By 1086 Bolesław was born. Three months after his birth, on 25 December, his mother died. In 1089 Władysław I Herman married [[Judith of Swabia]]  who was renamed Sophia in order to distinguish herself from Władysław I&apos;s first wife. Judith of Swabia was a daughter of Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] and widow of [[Solomon of Hungary]]. Through this marriage Bolesław gained three or four half-sisters, and as a consequence he remained the only legitimate son and heir.

Following Bolesław’s birth the political climate in the country changed. The position of Bolesław as an heir to the throne was threatened by the presence of [[Mieszko Bolesławowic]] who was already seventeen at the time and was furthermore, by agreement with Herman himself, the first in line to succeed. In all likelihood it was this situation that precipitated the young prince Mieszko’s demise in 1089. In that same year Wladyslaw I Herman’s first-born son Zbigniew was sent out of the country to a convent in [[Quedlinburg]], [[Saxony]]. This suggests that Wladyslaw I Herman intended to be rid of Zbigniew, make him a monk, and therefore deprive him of any chance of succession. This eliminated two pretenders to the Polish throne, secured young Bolesław’s inheritance as well as diminished the growing opposition to Wladyslaw I Herman among the nobility. Shortly after his ascension, however, [[Władysław I Herman]] was forced by the barons to give up the de facto reigns of government to Count Palatine [[Sieciech]]. This turn of events was likely due to the fact that Herman owed the throne to the barons, the most powerful of whom was [[Sieciech]]. The final stage of the mission retuned to Stettin (Szczecin), Wollin (Wolin) and Kammin (Cammin, Kamien). The [[Conversion of Pomerania|Christianization of Pomerania]] is considered one of the greatest accomplishments of Boleslaw’s III Pomeranian policy.

Once the missionary activities of Otto of Bamberg took root Boleslaw III began to implement an ecclesiastical organization of Pomerania. [[Pomerelia]] was added to the [[Diocese of Włocławek]], known at the time as the Kujavian Diocese. A strip of borderland north of Notec was split between the [[Diocese of Gniezno]] and [[Diocese of Poznan]]. The bulk of Pomerania was however made an independent [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kammin|Pomeranian bishoporic]], set up in the territory of the [[Duchy of Pomerania]] in 1140, after Boleslaw had died in 1138 and the duchy had broken away from Poland. [[Wartislaw I, Duke of Pomerania]] also accepted the Emperor as his overlord.

Duke  Boleslaw III was not only a predatory warrior, and a cunning politician and a diplomat. He was also a patron of cultural developments in his realm. Like most medieval monarchs he founded several churches and monasteries most important of which are; the monastery of [[Canons regular of St. Augustine]]in [[Trzemeszno]] founded in the 1100s and a [[Benedictine]] [[Łysa Góra|monastery of Holy Cross]] atop the [[Łysa Góra]] which was founded in place of an ancient pagan temple. Also the first major Polish chronicle written by one [[Gallus Anonymus]] dates back to the reign of duke Boleslaw III.

In 1135, Boleslaw finally gave his belated oath of allegiance to the new [[Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Lothair II]] (Lothar von Supplinburg), and paid  twelve years past due tribute. The emperor granted Boleslaw parts of Western [[Pomerania]] and [[Rügen]] as [[fief]]s, however the emperor was not in control of these areas and Bolesław also failed to subdue them.

Boleslaw also campaigned in [[Hungary]] 1132– 1135, but to little effect.

Before his death in 1138, Boleslaw Wrymouth published [[Bolesław Wrymouth&apos;s testament|his testament]] dividing his lands among four of his sons. The &quot;Senioral Principle&quot; established in the testament stated that at all times the eldest member of the dynasty was to have supreme power over the rest and was also to control an indivisible &quot;senioral part&quot;: a vast strip of land running north-south down the middle of Poland, with [[Kraków]] its chief city. The Senior&apos;s prerogatives also included control over Pomerania, a fief of the Holy Roman Empire. The &quot;senioral principle&quot; was soon broken, leading to a period of nearly 200 years of [[fragmentation of Poland|Poland&apos;s feudal fragmentation]].

By 16 November 1102 Boleslaw married firstly with [[Zbyslava of Kiev|Zbyslava]] (b. ca. 1085/90 - d. ca. 1112), daughter of Grand Duke [[Sviatopolk II of Kiev|Sviatopolk II]] of [[Kiev]]. They had three children:
