Bossert]], with control over the state legislature and an ally in Governor [[Ed Jackson]]. At its height, national membership during the second Klan movement reached 1.5 million, with 300,000 from Indiana. Records show that Wayne County, home to Whitewater Klan No. 60, was a Klan stronghold, with up to 45 percent of the county&apos;s white males having been Klan members. Robert Lyons, of Richmond, was national chief of staff for the Klan.
