The Barretts of Wimpole Street is a 1934 film depicting the real-life romance between poets [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Elizabeth Barrett]] ([[Norma Shearer]]) and [[Robert Browning]] ([[Fredric March]]), despite the opposition of her father [[Edward Moulton-Barrett]] ([[Charles Laughton]]). The film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. It was written by [[Ernest Vajda]], [[Claudine West]] and [[Donald Ogden Stewart]], from the play by [[Rudolph Besier]]. The film was directed by [[Sidney Franklin (director)|Sidney Franklin]].

In 1957, Sidney Franklin filmed a word-for-word, and nearly shot-for-shot [[Metrocolor]] [[The Barretts of Wimpole Street (1957 film)|remake]], of The Barretts of Wimpole Street, in [[CinemaScope]]. This version starred [[Jennifer Jones]] as Elizabeth, [[John Gielgud]] as her father, [[Bill Travers]] as Robert Browning, and [[Keith Baxter (actor)|Keith Baxter]] in his film debut.

Both of the films were released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]].

The story takes place for the most part within the lavish home of Edward Barrett ([[Charles Laughton]]) and his many grown children. Upstairs, Elizabeth ([[Norma Shearer]]), the oldest girl, consults with her doctor. She is recovering from an undisclosed illness and is extremely weak, but the doctor says it is possible for her to make a full recovery. She has great difficulty standing and walking, but he urges her to try.

Her mind is quite lively; she writes and publishes poetry, has a cute cocker spaniel named Flush, and she likes being entertained by her siblings, especially her youngest sister, Henrietta ([[Maureen O&apos;Sullivan]]). However, Edward is greatly displeased by the goings-on in Elizabeth&apos;s room. He wastes no opportunity to remind Elizabeth that she is very ill and perhaps dying. He seems determined to keep her confined, and not to allow her to recover fully, to the point of countermanding her doctor&apos;s orders. When she reports that a prescription for [[porter (beer)|porter]] makes her feel worse, the doctor takes her off it and puts her on hot milk instead, but Edward forces her to continue drinking porter in a spirit of obedience to his will. His tyranny over the boys is portrayed in less detail, but it is clear that they as well as the girls are terrified of him.

Meanwhile, Henrietta is interested in marrying one of the brothers&apos; friends, Surtees Cook ([[Ralph Forbes]]), who has a promising career in the military. But she tells him it is impossible. An incredibly  possessive father, Barrett has forbidden any of his children - even the six boys - to marry.

Robert Browning ([[Fredric March]]) arrives in a snowstorm, and immediately sweeps Ba off her feet. He says he&apos;s read her published poems and is in love with her already. He dismisses the idea that she is dying and tells her she must live. When he leaves her room, she rises from her settee for the first time and drags herself to the window so she can see him as he departs.

Months pass; Ba is able to walk slowly and to go downstairs to see Robert. Edward warns her not to overdo it and tells her it&apos;s just a temporary recovery. The doctors prescribe a trip to Italy for the winter. Edward is considering it, when chatty Cousin Bella ([[Marion Clayton]]) spills the beans that Ba&apos;s relationship with Robert isn&apos;t just the meeting of two poetic intellects. Edward immediately vetoes the trip and leaves the house, saying he&apos;s got another idea that may help her get the fresh air and sunshine she wants without having to leave the country. While he&apos;s gone, Robert and Ba meet in Kensington Gardens. He assures her that he himself will take her to Italy and that she should be ready by the end of the month. She says she&apos;ll think about it and let him know.

Edward&apos;s plan turns out to be a scheme to get Ba out of London, away from friends and activity, all for the good of her health, of course. He writes to her, bidding her tell her siblings that he&apos;s about to sell the house and move them all out to Surrey, six miles from the nearest railway station. Ba relays the message but doesn&apos;t tell Henrietta, who is now firmly committed to Surtees.

Edward returns unexpectedly early and catches Henrietta and Surtees showing off his dress uniform for Ba in her room. Brutally grasping her wrists, he forces Henrietta to confess that she and Surtees have been seeing each other. Denouncing her as a whore, he makes her swear on the Bible never to see Surtees again and to lock herself in her room until he allows her freedom. Ba witnesses all of this. When Edward starts in on her for aiding and abetting the relationship, she tells him the truth about how she feels - that far from obeying him out of love, she hates him, condemning and denouncing him as a tyrant. He unrepentantly leaves the room saying she can send for him when she has repented of her sins.

Ba conspires with her maid Wilson to let Robert know she will elope with him and Wilson is coming along. Henrietta, when set free, runs to Ba and exclaims that she will break her Bible oath, lie to her father if necessary, and run away with Surtees if she must.

Edward enters and dismisses Henrietta to speak to Ba alone. He opens up to her and confesses his real feelings and the motivation for his &quot;dragon&quot; behavior. Edward apparently thinks of himself as having a [[sex addiction]], and although the language in this scene is extremely euphemistic, we can gather that he tyrannized his wife as well, and that some of the children may actually have been conceived through marital rape. Edward now suppresses all his desires, equating all sex with sin, and he wants his children never to fall prey to carnal passion. As he goes into detail about how he wants Ba all to himself, to have her confide in him all her thoughts and feelings, he embraces her and actually comes close to making a sexual pass. Horrified of his inhuman behavior, Ba repulses him, and cries out that he must leave her. He apologizes and leaves, saying he&apos;ll pray for her.

Ba summons Wilson, puts on her cloak and hat, takes her little dog Flush and departs. As the two sneak down the stairs, we hear Edward saying grace over dinner. A few moments later, we hear the hysterical laughter of Ba&apos;s sister Arabel ([[Katharine Alexander]]). The boys rush upstairs, followed by Henrietta, to find that Ba has left one letter for each of the siblings and Edward. Edward reads his letter and staggers to the window. As if drunk, he insanely mutters &quot;I&apos;ll have her dog,&quot; and bids his son Octavius take Flush to the vet and have her destroyed. Octavius cries out that it is unjust, and Henrietta triumphantly drives the final blow; &quot;In her letter to me Ba writes that she has taken Flush with her...&quot; The film closes with a brief scene of Elizabeth&apos;s and Robert&apos;s marriage, with Wilson as a witness and Flush waiting patiently by the church door.
