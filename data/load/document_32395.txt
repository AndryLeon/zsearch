<title>Hampstead</title>
<text>

Hampstead is an area of [[London]], [[England]], located  north-west of [[Charing Cross]]. It is located in [[Inner London]]. It is part of the [[London Borough of Camden]]. It is known for its intellectual, liberal, artistic, musical and literary associations and for the large and hilly parkland [[Hampstead Heath]]. It is also home to some of the most expensive housing in the London area, or indeed anywhere in the world, with large houses regularly listed for sale at over twenty million pounds. The village of Hampstead has more millionaires within its boundaries than any other area of the [[United Kingdom]].

The name comes from the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] words ham  and stede, which means, and is a cognate of, the Modern English &quot;homestead&quot;.

Although early records of Hampstead can be found in a grant by King [[Ethelred the Unready]] to the monastery of St. Peter’s at Westminster (AD 986) and it is referred to in the [[Domesday Book]] (1086), the history of Hampstead is generally traced back to the 17th century.

Trustees of the Well started advertising the medicinal qualities of the [[chalybeate]] waters (water impregnated with iron) in 1700. Although Hampstead Wells was initially most successful and fashionable, its popularity declined in the 1800s due to competition with other fashionable London spas. The spa was demolished in 1882, although a water fountain was left behind.

Hampstead started to expand following the opening of the [[North London Railway]] in the 1860s (now the [[London Overground]] with passenger services operated by [[Transport for London]]), and expanded further after the [[Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway]] opened in 1907 (now part of [[London Underground]]&apos;s [[Northern Line]]) and provided fast travel to central [[London]].

Much luxurious housing was created during the 1870s and 1880s, in the area that is now the political ward of Frognal &amp; Fitzjohns. Much of this housing remains to this day.

During the 20th century, a number of notable buildings were created. These include:
Hampstead tube station]] (1907), incidentally the deepest station on the entire Underground network;
Isokon building]] (1932)
Hillfield Court]] (1932)
2 Willow Road]] (1938)
Hampstead Theatre]] (1962)
Swiss Cottage Leisure Centre]] (1964)
Swiss Cottage Central Library]] (1964)
Royal Free Hospital]] (1974)

Of these, the [[Hampstead Theatre]] relocated in 2003 to the present [[Swiss Cottage]] site (increasing capacity from 140 to 325 seats) and the Swiss Cottage leisure centre was closed for rebuilding in 2003 and reopened in 2006.

Cultural attractions in the area include the [[Freud Museum]], [[Keats&apos; House]], [[Kenwood House]], [[Fenton House]], The [[Isokon building]], [[Burgh House]], and the [[Camden Arts Centre]]. The large Victorian Hampstead Library and Town Hall was recently converted and extended as a creative industries centre.

Though now considered an integral part of London, Hampstead has retained much of its village atmosphere and charm, with Hampstead High Street playing a vital role in the day to day life of a Hampsteadian.

On 14 August 1975 Hampstead entered the [[UK Weather Records]] with the Highest 155-min total [[rainfall]] at 169 mm. As of November 2008 this record remains.

Mark Pevsner, the grandson of Sir [[Nicholas Pevsner]], described Hampstead as &quot;a large collection of roads and passages which don&apos;t go in straight lines, houses of different ages, many of them good architecture but more often it&apos;s just the way they fit together, full of nice vistas and surprises. Hampstead is a huge collection of twists and turns.&quot;

Hampstead became part of the [[County of London]] in 1889 and in 1899 the [[Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead]] was formed. The borough town hall on Haverstock Hill, which was also the location of the Registry Office, can be seen in newsreel footage of many celebrity civil marriages. In 1965 the metropolitan borough was abolished and its area merged with that of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Holborn]] and the [[Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras]] to form the modern-day [[London Borough of Camden]].

Hampstead is part of the [[Hampstead and Highgate]] constituency and since 1992 the member of parliament has been the former actress [[Glenda Jackson]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

The area has a significant tradition of educated liberal humanism, often referred to (often disparagingly) as &quot;Hampstead Liberalism&quot;.

The area is also home to the left-wing Labour magazine [[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]] and the satirical magazine the Hampstead Village Voice. The local paid-for newspaper is the Hampstead and Highgate Express, known locally as the &quot;Ham &amp; High&quot;. Hampstead is also covered by the borough-wide [[Camden New Journal]].

Since October 2008 the area has been represented on Camden Council by Liberal Democrat councilor Linda Chung, elected in a by-election to serve alongside Conservatives Kirsty Roberts and Chris Knight.

To the north and east of Hampstead, and separating it from [[Highgate]], is London&apos;s largest ancient parkland, [[Hampstead Heath]], which includes the well-known and legally-protected view of the London skyline from Parliament Hill. The Heath, a major place for Londoners to walk and &quot;take the air&quot;, has three open-air public [[Hampstead Ponds|swimming ponds]]; one for men, one for women, and one for mixed bathing, which were originally [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]] for drinking water and the sources of the [[River Fleet]]. The bridge pictured is known locally as &apos;The Red Arches&apos; or &apos;The Viaduct&apos;, built in fruitless anticipation of residential building on the Heath in the 19th century.

Local activities include major open-air concerts on summer Saturday evenings on the slopes below [[Kenwood House]], book and poetry readings, fun fairs on the lower reaches of the Heath, period harpsichord recitals at Fenton House, Hampstead Scientific Society and Hampstead Photographic Society.

The largest employer in Hampstead is the [[Royal Free Hospital]], Pond Street, but many small businesses based in the area have international significance. [[George Martin]]&apos;s [[Associated Independent Recording|AIR]] recording studios, in converted church premises in Lyndhurst Road, is a current example, as [[Jim Henson&apos;s Creature Shop]] was, before it relocated to California.

The area has some remarkable architecture, such as the [[Isokon building]] in Lawn Road, a [[Grade I listed]] experiment in collective housing, once home to [[Agatha Christie]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Ben Nicholson]] and [[Walter Gropius]]. It was recently restored by Notting Hill Housing Trust.

Hampstead is well known for its traditional [[pub]]s, such as the Holly Bush, gas-lit until recently; the [[Spaniards Inn|Spaniard&apos;s Inn]], Spaniard&apos;s Road, where highwayman [[Dick Turpin]] took refuge; [[The Old Bull and Bush]] in North End; and Ye Olde White Bear. Jack Straw&apos;s Castle on the edge of the Heath near Whitestone Pond at the brow of the Heath has now been converted into residential flats. Others include:

The 1986 fantasy film, [[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]], starring Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie, was shot, in large part, in Hampstead Heath. 

[[File:Hampsteadheath1.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The Heath]]Some scenes from [[An American Werewolf in London]] (1981) are shot on [[Hampstead Heath]], Well Walk and Haverstock Hill. Harry and Judith are killed in Hampstead Heath, behind the Priors on East Heath Road. Before David kills them, Harry and Judith get out of the taxi on East Heath Road at Well Walk. 

More recently [[Kenwood House]] is featured in the in-film film set scene of [[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]] (1999). Outdoor scenes in [[The Wedding Date]] (2005), starring [[Debra Messing]], feature [[Parliament Hill Fields]] on the Heath, overlooking west London. [[Four Weddings and a Funeral]] (1994) features the old Hampstead Town Hall on Haverstock Hill. The cult film [[Scenes of a Sexual Nature]] (2006) was filmed entirely on Hampstead Heath, covering various picturesque locations such as the &apos;Floating Gardens&apos; and [[Kenwood House]].

A musical specifically focusing on the area, [[Les Bicyclettes de Belsize]] (1968), tells the story of a young man&apos;s cycle journey around Hampstead. After crashing into a billboard poster, he falls in love with the fashion model depicted on it.

Hampstead has a major [[bus]] terminus known as [[Hampstead Heath]] (which is actually South End Green). Its most frequent service is Route 24 which for over 100 years has linked this area with the [[West End of London|West End]], [[Victoria, London|Victoria]] and [[Pimlico]] (Grosvenor Road).
Bus routes that currently serve Hampstead are:- [[London Buses route 24|24]] [[London Buses route 46|46]] [[London Buses route 168|168]] [[London Buses route 210|210]] [[London Buses route 268|268]] [[London Buses route 603|603]]  [[London Buses route C11|C11]] and [[London Buses route N5|N5]].

Hampstead has long been known as a residence of the intelligentsia, including writers, composers, and intellectuals, actors, artists and architects — many of whom created a bohemian community in the late 19th century. In the 1930s it became base to a community of avant garde artists and writers and was host to a number of émigrés and Jewish exiles from Nazi Europe.
