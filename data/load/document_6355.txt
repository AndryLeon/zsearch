Joanne  &quot;Jo&quot; Murray, [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (née Rowling; born 31 July 1965), better known under the [[pen name]] J. K. Rowling (, ), [[Forbes]] ranked Rowling as the forty-eighth most powerful celebrity of 2007, and [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] named her as a runner-up for its 2007 [[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]], noting the social, moral, and [[Politics of Harry Potter|political inspiration]] she has given [[Harry Potter fandom|her fandom]]. She has become a notable [[philanthropist]], supporting such charities as [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]], [[One Parent Families]], [[Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain]], and the [[Children&apos;s High Level Group]].

Although she writes under the [[pen name]] &quot;J. K. Rowling&quot;, pronounced like &quot;rolling&quot; (), her name when her first Harry Potter book was published was simply &quot;Joanne Rowling&quot;. Her publisher [[Bloomsbury Publishing Plc|Bloomsbury]] feared that the target audience of young boys might be reluctant to buy books written by a female author, and requested that she use two initials, rather than reveal her first name. As she had no middle name, she chose K as the second initial of her pseudonym, from her paternal grandmother Kathleen; it has never been part of her legal name. She calls herself &quot;Jo&quot; and said, &quot;No one ever called me &apos;Joanne&apos; when I was young, unless they were angry.&quot;

Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling and Anne Rowling (née Volant), on 31 July 1965 in [[Yate]],  [[Gloucestershire]], England,  northeast of [[Bristol]]. Her sister Dianne (Di) was born at their home on 28 June 1967 when Rowling was 23 months old. Mitford became Rowling&apos;s heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.

She attended secondary school at [[Wyedean School and College]]. Rowling has said of her adolescence, &quot;[[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] is loosely based on me. She&apos;s a caricature of me when I was eleven, which I&apos;m not particularly proud of.&quot;
Sean Harris, her best friend in the [[Sixth form|Upper Sixth]] owned a turquoise [[Ford Anglia#Anglia 105E|Ford Anglia]], which she says inspired the one in her books. &quot;Ron Weasley isn&apos;t a living portrait of Sean, but he really is very Sean-ish.&quot; Of her musical tastes of the time, she said &quot;My favourite group in the world is [[The Smiths]]. And when I was going through a punky phase, it was [[The Clash]].&quot; Rowling read for a BA in French and [[Classics]] at the [[University of Exeter]], which she says was a &quot;bit of a shock&quot; as she &quot;was expecting to be amongst lots of similar people– thinking radical thoughts.&quot; Once she made friends with &quot;some like-minded people&quot; she says she began to enjoy herself. With a year of study in Paris, Rowling moved to London to work as a researcher and bilingual secretary for [[Amnesty International]].

In 1990, while she was on a four-hour-delayed train trip from [[Manchester]] to London, the idea for a story of a young boy attending a school of wizardry &quot;came fully formed&quot; into her mind. 
When she had reached her [[Clapham Junction]] flat, she began to write immediately. 
Rowling said this death heavily affected her writing It was the feeling of her illness which brought her the idea of [[Dementors]], soulless creatures featured in Harry Potter.

After Jessica&apos;s birth and the separation from her husband, Rowling had left her teaching job in Portugal. In order to teach in Scotland she would need a postgraduate certificate of education (PGCE), requiring a full-time, year-long course of study. She began this course in August 1995, after completing her first novel while having survived on welfare. She wrote in many cafés, especially Nicolson&apos;s Café, whenever she could get Jessica to fall asleep. In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, remarking, &quot;I am not stupid enough to rent an unheated flat in Edinburgh in midwinter. It had heating.&quot; 
Instead, as she stated on the American TV program [[A&amp;E Biography]], one of the reasons she wrote in cafés was because taking her baby out for a walk was the best way to make her fall asleep. A year later she was finally given the green light (and a £1500 advance) by editor Barry Cunningham from [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]], a small British publishing house in London, England. Although Bloomsbury agreed to publish the book, Cunningham says that he advised Rowling to get a day job, since she had little chance of making money in children’s books. Soon after, in 1997, Rowling received an £8000 grant from the [[Scottish Arts Council]] to enable her to continue writing. The following spring, an auction was held in the United States for the rights to publish the novel, and was won by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Inc.]], for $105,000. Rowling has said she “nearly died” when she heard the news.

In June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher’s Stone with an initial print-run of 1000 copies, five hundred of which were distributed to libraries. Today, such copies are valued between £16,000 and £25,000. Five months later, the book won its first award, a [[Nestlé Smarties Book Prize]]. In February, the novel won the prestigious [[British Book Awards|British Book Award]] for [[British Children&apos;s Book of the Year|Children’s Book of the Year]], and later, the Children’s Book Award. Its sequel, [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]], was published in July, 1998. In October 1998, Scholastic published Philosopher’s Stone in the US under the title of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone: a change Rowling claims she now regrets and would have fought if she had been in a better position at the time. 

In December 1999, the third novel, [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]], won the Smarties Prize, making Rowling the first person to win the award three times running. She later withdrew the fourth Harry Potter novel from contention to allow other books a fair chance. In January 2000, Prisoner of Azkaban won the inaugural [[1999 Whitbread Awards|Whitbread Children’s Book of the Year award]], though it lost the Book of the Year prize to [[Seamus Heaney]]’s translation of [[Beowulf]].

The fourth book, [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]], was released simultaneously in the UK and the US on 8 July 2000, and broke sales records in both countries. Some 372,775 copies of the book were sold in its first day in the UK, almost equalling the number Prisoner of Azkaban sold during its first year. In the US, the book sold three million copies in its first 48 hours, smashing all literary sales records.

The title of the seventh and final Harry Potter book was revealed 21 December 2006 to be [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]. In February 2007 it was reported that Rowling wrote on a bust in her hotel room at the [[Balmoral Hotel]] in [[Edinburgh]] that she had finished the seventh book in that room on 11 January 2007. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released on 21 July 2007 (0:00 [[Western European Summer Time|BST]]) and broke its predecessor&apos;s record as the fastest-selling book of all time. During a year period when Rowling was completing the last book, she allowed herself to be filmed for a documentary which aired in Britain on [[ITV]] on 30 December 2007. It was entitled J K Rowling... A Year In The Life and showed her returning to her old Edinburgh tenement flat where she lived, and completed the first Harry Potter book. Re-visiting the flat for the first time reduced her to tears, saying it was &quot;really where I turned my life around completely.&quot; The series, totalling 4,195 pages, has been translated, in whole or in part, into 65 languages.

The Harry Potter books have also gained recognition for sparking an interest in reading among the young at a time when children were thought to be abandoning books for computers and television, although the series&apos; overall impact on children&apos;s reading habits has been questioned.

In October 1998, [[Warner Bros.]] purchased the film rights to the first two novels for a seven-figure sum. A film version of [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher&apos;s Stone]] was released on 16 November 2001, and [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]] on 15 November 2002. Both were directed by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]]. 4 June 2004 saw the release of the film version of [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]], directed by [[Alfonso Cuarón]]. The fourth film, [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]], was directed by another new director, [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]], and released on 18 November 2005. The film of [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]] was released on 11 July 2007. She did not give any details about the two projects but did state that she was excited because the two book situation reminded her of writing the Philosopher&apos;s Stone, explaining how she was then writing two books until Harry took over. She stated in October 2007 that her future work was unlikely to be in the fantasy genre, explaining, &quot;I think probably I&apos;ve done my fantasy ... it would be incredibly difficult to go out and create another world that didn&apos;t in some way overlap with Harry&apos;s or maybe borrow a little too much from Harry.&quot; In November 2007, Rowling said that she was working on another book, a &quot;half-finished book for children that I think will probably be the next thing I publish.&quot; In March 2008, Rowling confirmed that her &quot;political fairy tale&quot; for children was nearing completion.

In March 2008, Rowling revealed in interview that she had returned to writing in Edinburgh cafés, intent on composing a new novel for children. &quot;I will continue writing for children because that&apos;s what I enjoy,&quot; she told [[The Daily Telegraph]]. &quot;I am very good at finding a suitable café; I blend into the crowd and, of course, I don&apos;t sit in the middle of the bar staring all around me.&quot;

Forbes has named Rowling as the first person to become a U.S.-dollar billionaire by writing books, the second-richest female entertainer and the 1,062nd richest person in the world. When first listed as a billionaire by Forbes in 2004, Rowling disputed the calculations and said she had plenty of money, but was not a billionaire. In addition, the 2008 [[Sunday Times Rich List]] named Rowling the 144th richest person in Britain. on a street with 24-hour security.

On 26 December 2001, Rowling married Neil Michael Murray (born 30 June 1971), an [[anaesthetist]], in a private ceremony at her Aberfeldy home. This was a second marriage for both Rowling and Murray, as Murray had previously been married to Dr. Fiona Duncan in 1996. Murray and Duncan separated in 1999 and divorced in the summer of 2001. Rowling and Murray&apos;s son David Gordon Rowling Murray was born on 24 March 2003. Shortly after Rowling began writing Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince she took a break from working on the novel to care for him in his early infancy. Rowling&apos;s youngest child, daughter Mackenzie Jean Rowling Murray, to whom she dedicated [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]], was born 23 January 2005.

Rowling is a member of the [[Church of Scotland]]. She once said, &quot;I believe in God, not magic.&quot; Early on she felt that if readers knew of her [[Christian]] beliefs, they would be able to &quot;guess what is coming in the books.&quot; Rowling has stated that she struggles with her own beliefs. In an interview with the [[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]] in July 2007, she said, &quot;... until we reached Book Seven, views of what happens after death and so on ... would give away a lot of what was coming. So ... yes, my belief and my struggling with religious belief and so on I think is quite apparent in this book.&quot;

Rowling commented on her political views when she discussed the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]] with the Spanish-language newspaper [[El País]]. She said she is obsessed with the United States elections because they will have a profound effect on the rest of the world. In February 2008, she said that both [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] would be &quot;extraordinary&quot; in the White House. In the same interview, she also said her hero was [[Robert F. Kennedy]].

Rowling has received honorary degrees from [[St Andrews University]], the [[University of Edinburgh]], [[Napier University]], the [[University of Exeter]] and the [[University of Aberdeen]].
On 5 June 2008, Rowling spoke at the [[Harvard University]] commencement ceremony where she received another honorary degree. In 2009 Rowling was awarded the [[Légion d&apos;honneur]] by French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. She revealed publicly, during the Elysée Palace ceremony, that her maternal grandfather was French and had also received the [[Légion d&apos;honneur]] for his bravery at the First World War battle of Verdun. [[Matt Latimer]], a former speech writer for [[President George W Bush]] has claimed in his book Speechless: Tales of a White House Survivor that Rowling was turned down for the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] because [[White House]] officials in the Bush administration believed that the Harry Potter series promoted witchcraft.

Rowling has had a difficult relationship with the press. She admits to being &quot;thin-skinned&quot; and dislikes the fickle nature of reporting. &quot;They went in one day from saying, &apos;She’s got writer’s block&apos; to saying, &apos;She&apos;s been self-indulgent&apos;&quot;, she told The Times in 2003, &quot;And I thought, well, what a difference 24 hours makes.&quot; However, Rowling disputes her reputation as a recluse who hates to be interviewed. In 2001, the Press Complaints Commission upheld a complaint by Rowling over a series of unauthorised photographs of her with her daughter on the beach in [[Mauritius]] published in [[OK! Magazine]]. In 2007, Rowling&apos;s young son, David, assisted by Rowling and her husband, lost a court fight to ban publication of a photograph of him. The photo, taken by a photographer using a long-range lens, was subsequently published in a [[Daily Express#Sunday Express|Sunday Express]] article featuring Rowling&apos;s family life and motherhood.

Some have speculated that Rowling&apos;s fraught relationship with the press was the inspiration behind the character [[Rita Skeeter]]. However, Rowling noted in 2000 that the character actually predates her rise to fame: &quot;People have asked me whether Rita Skeeter was invented [to reflect Harry Potters popularity], but in fact she was always planned.&quot; &quot;I tried to put Rita in Philosopher&apos;s Stone - you know when Harry walks into the Leaky Cauldron for the first time and everyone says, &quot;Mr. Potter you&apos;re back!&quot;, I wanted to put a journalist in there. She wasn&apos;t called Rita then but she was a woman. And then I thought, as I looked at the plot overall, I thought, that&apos;s not really where she fits best, she fits best in Four when Harry&apos;s supposed to come to terms with his fame.&quot;

In 2000, Rowling established the Volant Charitable Trust, which uses its annual budget of £5.1 million to combat [[poverty]] and social inequality. The fund also gives to organisations that aid children, one parent families, and multiple sclerosis research. Rowling said, &quot;I think you have a moral responsibility when you&apos;ve been given far more than you need, to do wise things with it and give intelligently.&quot; Rowling collaborated with [[Sarah Brown (spouse)|Sarah Brown]], wife of British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]], to write a book of children&apos;s stories to aid One Parent Families.

In 2001, the UK anti-poverty fundraiser [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] asked three bestselling British authors – cookery writer and TV presenter [[Delia Smith]], [[Bridget Jones]] creator [[Helen Fielding]], and Rowling – to submit booklets related to their most famous works for publication. Rowling&apos;s two booklets, [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]] and [[Quidditch Through the Ages]], are ostensibly facsimiles of books found in the [[Hogwarts]] library. Since going on sale in March 2001, the books have raised £15.7 million ($30 million) for the fund. The £10.8 million ($20 million) they have raised outside the UK have been channeled into a newly created International Fund for Children and Young People in Crisis.

In 2005, Rowling and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Emma Nicholson]] founded the Children&apos;s High Level Group. In January 2006, Rowling went to [[Bucharest]] to highlight the use of caged beds in children&apos;s [[mental institution]]s. To further support the CHLG, Rowling auctioned one of seven handwritten and illustrated copies of [[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]], a series of fairy tales referred to in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The book was purchased for £1.95 million by on-line bookseller [[Amazon.com]] on 13 December 2007, becoming the most expensive modern book ever sold at auction. Rowling commented, &quot;This will mean so much to children in desperate need of help. It means Christmas has come early to me.&quot;

In May 2008, bookseller [[Waterstones]] asked Rowling and 12 other writers ([[Sebastian Faulks]], [[Doris Lessing]], [[Lisa Appignanesi]], [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Lauren Child]], [[Richard Ford]], [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Nick Hornby]], [[Michael Rosen]], [[Axel Scheffler]], [[Tom Stoppard]] and [[Irvine Welsh]]) to compose a short piece of their own choosing on a single [[ISO 216|A5]] card, which would then be sold at auction in aid of the charities Dyslexia Action and English [[International PEN|PEN]]. Rowling&apos;s contribution was an 800-word [[Harry Potter prequel]] that concerns Harry&apos;s father, [[Marauders_(Harry_Potter)#James_Potter|James Potter]] and godfather, [[Sirius Black]], and takes place three years before Harry was born. Rowling claims that she does not intend to return to Harry Potter for at least ten years. The cards were collected together and sold for charity in book form in August 2008. Rowling, along with [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Al Gore]], and [[Alan Greenspan]], wrote an introduction to a collection of Gordon Brown&apos;s speeches, the proceeds of which are donated to the Jennifer Brown Research Laboratory.

Rowling, her publishers and [[Time Warner]], the owner of the rights to the [[Harry Potter films]], have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyright, and also have been accused of copyright infringement themselves. The worldwide popularity of the Harry Potter series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them. While these legal proceedings have countered a number of cases of outright piracy, other attempts have targeted not-for-profit endeavours and have been criticised as a result as too draconian. 

Another area of legal dispute involves a series of injunctions obtained by Rowling and her publishers to prohibit anyone from reading her books before their official release date. These injunctions have very sweeping powers and have drawn fire from civil liberties and free speech campaigners and sparked debates over the &quot;right to read&quot;. The powers afforded by these injunctions have even been used in subsequent cases unrelated to publishing.
