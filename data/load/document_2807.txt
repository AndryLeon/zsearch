Chelsea Football Club () is an English professional [[Association football|football]] club based in [[West London]]. The team, founded in 1905, play in the [[Premier League]] and have spent most of their history in the top tier of [[Football in England|English football]]. Chelsea have been [[English football champions|English champions]] three times, and have won the [[FA Cup]] five times, the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] four times and the [[UEFA Cup Winners&apos; Cup]] twice.

The club had their first major success in [[1954-55 in English football|1955]], winning the league championship. Chelsea won several cup competitions during the 1960s and 1970s, but after that did not win another major title until 1997. The past decade has been the most successful period in Chelsea’s history, capped by winning consecutive Premier League titles in [[FA Premier League 2004–05|2005]] and [[FA Premier League 2005–06|2006]], and reaching their first [[UEFA Champions League]] final in [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|2008]].

Chelsea&apos;s home is the 42,055 capacity

Chelsea&apos;s traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours are [[royal blue]] shirts and shorts with [[white]] socks. The club crest has been changed several times in attempts to modernize or re-brand; the current crest, featuring a ceremonial lion holding a staff, is a modified version of one first adopted in the 1950s. The club has sustained the fifth highest average all-time attendance in English football. Their average home gate for the 2008–09 season was 41,464, the fifth highest in the Premier League.

Chelsea were founded on 14 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher&apos;s Hook), opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on [[Fulham Road]], and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards. The club&apos;s early years saw little success; the closest they came to winning a major trophy was reaching the [[FA Cup]] final in [[1915 FA Cup Final|1915]], where they lost to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. Chelsea gained a reputation for signing big-name players and for being entertainers, but made little impact on the English game in the inter-war years.

Former [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[England national football team|England]] centre-forward [[Ted Drake]] became manager in 1952 and proceeded to modernise the club. He removed the club&apos;s [[Chelsea pensioner]] crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt the side, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success – the League championship – in [[1954–55 in English football|1954–55]]. The following season saw [[UEFA]] create the [[UEFA Champions League|European Champions&apos; Cup]], but after objections from [[The Football League]] and the [[The Football Association|FA]] Chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before it started.

The 1960s saw the emergence of a talented young Chelsea side under manager [[Tommy Docherty]]. They challenged for honours throughout the decade, and endured several near-misses. They were on course for a treble of League, FA Cup and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] going into the final stages of the [[1964–65 in English football|1964–65]] season, winning the League Cup but faltering late on in the other two. In three seasons the side were beaten in three major semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up. In 1970 Chelsea were FA Cup winners, beating [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] 2–1 in a [[1970 FA Cup Final|final replay]]. Chelsea took their first European honour, a [[UEFA Cup Winners&apos; Cup]] triumph, the following year, with another replayed win, this time over [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in [[Athens]].

The late 1970s and the 1980s were a turbulent period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club, star players were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious [[hooliganism|hooligan]] element among the support, which was to plague the club throughout the decade. In 1982 Chelsea were, at the nadir of their fortunes, acquired by [[Ken Bates]] for the nominal sum of £1, although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing their home. On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] for the first time, but in 1983 manager [[John Neal (footballer)|John Neal]] put together an impressive new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in [[1983–84 in English football|1983–84]] and established themselves in the top division, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]].

After a long-running legal battle, Bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a deal with the banks of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash. Chelsea&apos;s form in the new [[Premier League]] was unconvincing, although they did reach the FA Cup final in [[1994 FA Cup Final|1994]]. It was not until the appointment of former [[Ballon d&apos;Or|European Footballer of the Year]] [[Ruud Gullit]] as [[player-manager]] in 1996 that their fortunes changed. He added several top-class international players to the side, as the club won the [[FA Cup]] in [[FA Cup Final 1997|1997]] and established themselves as one of England&apos;s top sides again. Gullit was replaced by [[Gianluca Vialli]], who led the team to victory in the [[Football League Cup Final 1998|League Cup]] and the [[UEFA Cup Winners&apos; Cup 1997–98|Cup Winners&apos; Cup]] in 1998, the FA Cup in [[FA Cup Final 2000|2000]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]] quarter-finals in 2000. Vialli was sacked in favour of another Italian, [[Claudio Ranieri]], who guided Chelsea to the [[2002 FA Cup Final]] and Champions League qualification in [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03]].

In June 2003, Bates sold Chelsea to Russian billionaire [[Roman Abramovich]] for £140 million, completing what was then the biggest-ever sale of an English football club.

During the late 1960s and early 70s, the club&apos;s owners embarked on a modernisation of Stamford Bridge with plans for a 50,000 all-seater stadium. As a stop-gap, a temporary emblem comprising simply the initials C.F.C. was adopted for one year. 

In 1953, Chelsea&apos;s crest was changed to an upright blue [[lion]] looking backwards and holding a [[staff (stick)|staff]], which was to endure for the next three decades. This crest was based on elements in the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea]] with the &quot;lion rampant regardant&quot; taken from the arms of then club president [[Earl Cadogan|Viscount Chelsea]] and the staff from the [[Westminster Abbey|Abbots of Westminster]], former Lords of the Manor of Chelsea. It also featured three red roses, to represent England, and two footballs. This was the first club badge to appear on shirts, since the policy of putting the crest on the shirts was only adopted in the early 1960s. This record is unlikely to be broken in the near future; Chelsea&apos;s current highest appearance-maker is [[Frank Lampard]] with 287 for the club (427 total for his career). The record for a Chelsea goalkeeper is held by Harris&apos;s contemporary, [[Peter Bonetti]], who made 729 appearances (1959–79). With 116 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] (74 while at the club), [[Marcel Desailly]] of [[France national football team|France]] is Chelsea&apos;s most capped international player.

[[Bobby Tambling]] is Chelsea&apos;s all-time top goalscorer, with 202 goals in 370 games (1959–70). and the most consecutive clean sheets from the start of a league season (6).

The club&apos;s 21–0 [[Aggregate score|aggregate]] victory over [[Jeunesse Hautcharage]] in the [[UEFA Cup Winners&apos; Cup 1971-72|UEFA Cup Winners&apos; Cup in 1971]] remains a record in European competition. Chelsea hold the record for the longest streak of unbeaten matches at home in the English top-flight, which lasted 86 matches from 20 March 2004 to 26 October 2008. They secured the record on 12 August 2007, beating the previous record of 63 matches unbeaten set by Liverpool between 1978 and 1980. Chelsea&apos;s streak of eleven consecutive away league wins, set between 5 April 2008 and 6 December 2008, is also a record for the English top flight.

Chelsea have recorded several &quot;firsts&quot; in English football. Along with Arsenal, they were the first club to play with shirt numbers on 25 August 1928 in their match against [[Swansea Town F.C.|Swansea Town]]. Chelsea were the first English side to travel by [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aeroplane]] to a domestic away match, when they visited [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 19 April 1957, and the first [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side to play a match on a Sunday, when they faced [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] on 27 January 1974. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first British side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up (no British or Irish players) in a [[Premier League]] match against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. On 19 May 2007, they became the first team to win the FA Cup at the new [[Wembley Stadium]], having also been the last to win it at the old Wembley.
After the conclusion of the 2007/08 season, Chelsea became the highest ranked club under [[UEFA]]&apos;s five-year [[UEFA coefficient|coefficient]] system used in the seeding of European club competitions in the following season, the first English club to do so in the 21st century.

In 1930, Chelsea featured in one of the earliest football films, [[The Great Game (film)|The Great Game]]. One-time Chelsea centre forward, [[Jack Cock]], who by then was playing for [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], was the star of the film and several scenes were shot at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], including the pitch, the boardroom, and the [[dressing room]]s. It included guest appearances by then-Chelsea players [[Andrew Nesbit Wilson|Andrew Wilson]], [[George Mills (footballer)|George Mills]], and [[Sam Millington]]. Owing to the notoriety of the [[Chelsea Headhunters]], a [[football firm]] associated with the club, Chelsea have also featured in films about football [[hooliganism]], most recently [[The Football Factory (film)|The Football Factory]]. Chelsea also appear in the [[Hindi language|Hindi]] film [[Jhoom Barabar Jhoom]].

Up until the 1950s, the club had a long-running association with the [[music hall]]s, with their underachievement often providing material for comedians such as [[George Robey]]. It culminated in comedian Norman Long&apos;s release of a [[Novelty song|comic song]] in 1933, ironically titled &quot;On the Day That Chelsea Went and Won the Cup&quot;, the lyrics of which describe a series of bizarre and improbable occurrences on the hypothetical day when Chelsea finally won a trophy.

The song &quot;[[Blue is the Colour (Chelsea)|Blue is the Colour]]&quot; was released as a single in the build-up to the [[1972 Football League Cup Final|1972 League Cup Final]], with all members of Chelsea&apos;s first team squad singing; it reached number five in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The song was later adapted to &quot;White is the Colour&quot; and adopted as an anthem by the [[Vancouver Whitecaps (USL)|Vancouver Whitecaps]] in [[Canada]]. In the build-up to the [[FA Cup Final 1997|1997 FA Cup final]], the song &quot;Blue Day&quot;, performed by [[Suggs (singer)|Suggs]] and members of the Chelsea squad, reached number 22 in the UK charts. [[Bryan Adams]], a fan of Chelsea, dedicated the song &quot;We&apos;re Gonna Win&quot; from the [[album]] [[18 Til I Die]] to the club.

As of 20 November 2009.
