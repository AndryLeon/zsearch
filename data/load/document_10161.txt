Punctuated equilibrium is a [[theory]] in [[Evolution|evolutionary biology]] which proposes that most [[Sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] [[species]] will experience little evolutionary change for most of their geological history (in an extended state called stasis). When evolution occurs, it is localized in rare, rapid events of branching speciation (called [[cladogenesis]]). Cladogenesis is simply the process by which species split into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another. Thus, &quot;punctuated equilibria is a model for discontinuous tempos of change (in) the process of speciation and the deployment of species in geological time.&quot;

Punctuated equilibrium is commonly contrasted against the theory of [[phyletic gradualism]], which states that evolution generally occurs uniformly and by the steady and gradual transformation of whole lineages ([[anagenesis]]). In this view, evolution is seen as generally smooth and continuous.

In 1972 paleontologists [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] published a landmark paper developing this theory and called it punctuated equilibria. Their paper was built upon [[Ernst Mayr|Ernst Mayr&apos;s]] theory of [[allopatric speciation|geographic speciation]], [[I. Michael Lerner]]&apos;s theories of developmental and genetic homeostasis, as well as their own empirical research. Eldredge and Gould proposed that the degree of gradualism commonly attributed to [[Charles Darwin]] was virtually nonexistent in the fossil record, and that stasis dominates the history of most [[fossil]] species.

Punctuated equilibrium originated as an extension of [[Ernst Mayr|Ernst Mayr&apos;s]] concept of genetic revolutions by [[Allopatric speciation|allopatric]] and especially [[peripatric speciation]]. Although much of the basic workings of the theory were proposed and identified by Mayr in 1954, Punctuated equilibrium differed from Mayr simply in that Eldredge and Gould had placed considerably greater emphasis on stasis, whereas Mayr was generally concerned with explaining the morphological discontinuity (or &quot;punctuational patterns&quot;) found in the fossil record.
According to Gould &quot;the ideas came mostly from Niles, with yours truly acting as a sounding board and eventual scribe. I coined the term punctuated equilibrium and wrote most of our 1972 paper, but Niles is the proper first author in our pairing of Eldredge and Gould.&quot;

When Eldredge and Gould published their 1972 paper, [[allopatric speciation]] held the position as the &quot;standard&quot; theory of speciation.

Allopatric speciation suggests that species which are composed of large central populations are stabilized by their large volume and the genetic process of [[gene flow]]. New and even [[Mutation#Beneficial mutations|beneficial mutations]] are diluted by the population&apos;s size and are unable to reach fixation due to factors such as constantly changing environments. If this is the case, then the transformation of whole lineages should be rare, as the fossil record indicates. Smaller populations on the other hand, which are isolated from the parental stock, are decoupled from the [[wikt:Homogeneous|homogenizing]] effects of gene flow. In addition, pressure from [[natural selection]] is especially intense, as peripheral isolated populations exist at the outer edges of ecological tolerance. If most evolution happens in these rare instances of allopatric speciation then evidence of gradual evolution should be rare. This stimulating [[hypothesis]] was alluded upon by Mayr in the closing paragraph of his 1954 paper.
 
Ernst Mayr often emphasized the use of population thinking to describe species, rather than models which evoked a [[Essentialism|typological]] approach. In order to contrast the differences in population structures he coined the terms [[ecotypic variation|ecotypic]] and [[typostrophic variation]]. Ecotypic variation describes the genetics of large central populations which are stabilized by the homogenizing effects of gene flow. Small peripherally isolated populations, in contrast, possess typostrophic variation which &quot;have the characteristic features of incipient species, but what is more important they often are species or incipient species of an entirely new type. That is, they may have morphological or ecological features that deviate quite strikingly and unexpectedly from the &apos;parental&apos; pattern.&quot; Sterelny notes that &quot;in recent work, they have clarified a second misunderstanding. In claiming that species typically undergo no further evolutionary change once speciation is complete, they are not claiming that there is no change at all between one generation and the next. Lineages do change. But the change between generations does not accumulate. Instead, over time, the species wobbles about its [[phenotypic]] mean. [[Jonathan Weiner|Jonathan Weiner&apos;s]] [[The Beak of the Finch]] describes this very process&quot;.

Punctuated equilibrium is often confused with [[George Gaylord Simpson|George Gaylord Simpson&apos;s]] [[quantum evolution]], [[Richard Goldschmidt|Richard Goldschmidt&apos;s]] [[Saltation (biology)|saltationism]], pre-Lyellian [[catastrophism]], and the phenomenon of [[mass extinction]]. Punctuated equilibrium is therefore mistakenly thought to oppose the concept of [[Gradualism#Geology and biology|gradualism]], when it is actually a form of gradualism, in the ecological sense of biological continuity. argued that Gould&apos;s use of analogy and metaphor constitutes a non-scientific discourse serving to validate a scientific theory. Scott accuses Gould—particularly in his popular essays—of using a variety of strategies from literature, political science, and personal anecdotes to substantiate the general pattern of punctuated equilibrium (long periods of stasis interrupted by rapid, catastrophic change). Gould responded that critics often made the mistake of confusing the context of discovery with the context of [[Epistemology|justification]]. While Gould is celebrated for the color and energy of his prose, as well as his massive interdisciplinary knowledge, critics such as Scott have concerns that the theory has gained undeserved credence among non-scientists because of Gould&apos;s rhetorical skills.

It is often incorrectly assumed that he insisted that the rate of change must be constant, or nearly so, but even the first edition of [[On the Origin of Species]] states that &quot;Species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate, or in the same degree. In the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms... The Silurian Lingula differs but little from the living species of this genus&quot;. [[Lingula (genus)|Lingula]] is among the few brachiopods surviving today but also known from fossils over 500 million years old. In the fifth edition of On the Origin of Species Darwin wrote that &quot;the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form.&quot; Thus punctuationism in general is consistent with Darwin&apos;s conception of evolution.

According to early versions of punctuated equilibrium, &quot;peripheral isolates&quot; are considered to be of critical importance for speciation. However, Darwin wrote, &quot;I can by no means agree … that immigration and isolation are necessary elements.…  Although isolation is of great importance in the production of new species, on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness of area is still more important, especially for the production of species which shall prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading widely.&quot;

The importance of isolation in forming species had played a significant part in Darwin&apos;s early thinking, as shown in his Essay of 1844. But by the time he wrote the Origin he had downplayed its importance. He explained the reasons for his revised view as follows:

Thus punctuated equilibrium contradicts some of Darwin&apos;s ideas regarding the specific mechanisms of evolution, but generally accords with Darwin&apos;s theory of evolution by natural selection.

Recent work in [[developmental biology]] has identified dynamical and physical mechanisms of [[morphogenesis|tissue morphogenesis]] that may underlie abrupt morphological transitions during evolution. Consequently, consideration of mechanisms of phylogenetic change that are actually (not just apparently) non-gradual is increasingly common in the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]], particularly in studies of the origin of morphological novelty. A description of such mechanisms can be found in the multi-authored volume [[Origination of Organismal Form]] (MIT Press; 2003).

Punctuated equilibrium in [[social theory]] is a method of understanding change in complex social systems, particularly how policy change and the evolution of conflicts seem to progress in extended periods of stasis, punctuated by sudden shifts in radical change.
