[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]&apos;s location, nestled between the [[Black Sea]], [[Russia]], and [[Turkey]], gives it strategic importance far beyond its size. It is developing as the gateway from the Black Sea to the [[Caucasus]] and the larger Caspian region, but also serves as a buffer between Russia and Turkey. Georgia has a long and close relationship with Russia, but it is reaching out to its other neighbors and looking to the West in search of alternatives and opportunities. It signed a partnership and cooperation agreement with the [[European Union]], participates in the [[Partnership for Peace]], and encourages foreign investment. [[France]], [[Germany]],  the [[United Kingdom]],and the [[United States]] all have embassies in [[Tbilisi]].

Georgia is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Council of Europe]], and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]]

Because of its strategic location it is in both the [[Russia]]n and [[United States|American]] spheres of influence. In common with many ex-Soviet republics it is both influenced by and fearful of its larger neighbour. The invitation of US troops into the country caused tension with [[Moscow]]. The [[Russian government]] also believes that Georgia is being used by [[Chechnya|Chechen]] separatsts. The American government has interests in an oil pipeline passing through the country. Former president [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] attempted to balance these competing demands. The new leadership is much closer to the United States.

Disputes - international:
Georgia relationships with Russia are at it lowest point in modern history due to [[2006 Georgian-Russian espionage controversy|Georgian-Russian espionage controversy]] and due to the [[2008 South Ossetia war]], Georgia broke off diplomatic relations with Russia and has left the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].
