Politics of Estonia takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of Estonia]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the parliament. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the [[Government of Estonia|Government]] which is led by the [[Prime Minister of Estonia|Prime Minister]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Estonian civil service is relatively young. Over 50% of civil servants aged under 40 and a third aged under 30. 42 % of civil servants are male and 58% female. Around half of civil servants have a tertiary degree.

Estonia has a relatively low number of bureaucrats, 18,998 in the central government and 4500 in local governments. Central government institutions include: 11 Ministries (2,593 employees), 33 Administrative agencies, Boards and Inspectorates (14,790 employees), 6 Constitutional Institutions (805 employees), 15 County Governments (810 employees), and other institutions (National Archives, Prosecutor&apos;s Office etc.). There are 241 local government authorities employing about 4500 public servants.

The [[Estonian Declaration of Independence]] was issued in 1918. A parliamentary republic was formed by the [[Estonian Constituent Assembly]] and the first Constitution of Estonia was adopted on June 15, 1920. The parliament [[Riigikogu]] (State Assembly) elected a [[Riigivanem]] who acted both as [[Head of Government]] and [[Head of State]]. During the [[Era of Silence]] political parties were banned and the parliament was not in session between 1934 and 1938 as the country was ruled by [[decree]] by [[Konstantin Päts]], who was elected as the first [[President of Estonia]] in 1938. In 1938 a new constitution was passed and [[Riigikogu]] was convened once again, this time [[bicameral]]ly, consisting of [[Riigivolikogu]] ([[upper house]]) and [[Riiginõukogu]] ([[lower house]]), both meaning State Council in direct translation. In 1940 Estonia was occupied by the [[Soviet Union]]. A year later, the [[Soviet]] occupation was taken over by a [[Nazi German]] one. During the course of the two occupations legal institutions, elected according to the constitution approved by the people, were removed from power. In September 1944, after German forces left, legal power was briefly restored as [[Otto Tief]] formed a new government in accordance with the [[1938 constitution]]. [[The Tief government]], though, lasted for  only 5 days, as Estonia was again occupied by the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1991 the Republic of Estonia was restored on the basis of continuity with the constitution prior to 1938, with the public approving a new constitution in 1992.

The contemporary Estonian government follows the principles of separation of power and its people elect a 101-member [[Riigikogu]] every four years. Only Estonian citizens may participate in parliamentary elections. Estonia uses a voting system based on [[proportional representation]]. A party must exceed a national threshold of 5% of all votes to gain entry to the parliament.  The Parliament elects a president, who can be in office for a five year period for a maximum of two terms in succession. As a rule, the president asks the party leader who has collected the most votes to form the new government, who then must gain the approval of [[Riigikogu]]. The parliament also appoints the president of the [[Estonian National Bank]], the [[Chief of the Headquarters of the Estonian Defense]], the [[Comptroller General of Estonia]], the [[Chancellor of Justice of Estonia]] and the [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Estonia]], all on the proposal of the [[President of Estonia]].

In the years shortly following the restoration of independence, there were dozens of parties to represent a population of only 1.3 million; at present 6 main parties are in the parliament. The local authorities have developed in much the same direction. All permanent residents of voting age (18) may participate in local elections. Estonia does not have a state church, religious freedom is guaranteed by the constitution.

On June 28, 1992, [[Estonia]]n voters approved the constitutional assembly&apos;s draft constitution and implementation act, which established a parliamentary government with a president as chief of state and with a government headed by a prime minister.

The [[Riigikogu]], a unicameral legislative body, is the highest organ of state authority. It initiates and approves legislation sponsored by the prime minister. The prime minister has full responsibility and control over his cabinet. Parliamentary and presidential elections were held on September 20, 1992. Approximately 68% of the country&apos;s 637,000 registered voters cast ballots. [[Lennart Meri]], an outstanding writer and former [[Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], won this election and became [[President of Estonia|president]]. He chose 32-year-old historian and Christian Democratic Party founder [[Mart Laar]] as prime minister.

In February 1992, and with amendments in January 1995, the [[Riigikogu]] renewed Estonia&apos;s 1938 citizenship law, which also provides equal civil protection to resident aliens.

In 1996, Estonia ratified a border agreement with [[Latvia]] and completed work with [[Russia]] on a technical border agreement. President [[Lennart Meri|Meri]] was re-elected in free and fair indirect elections in August and September in 1996. During parliamentary elections in 1999, the seats in [[Riigikogu]] were divided as follows: the [[Estonian Centre Party|Centre Party]] received 28, the [[Pro Patria Union (Estonia)|Pro Patria Union]] 18, the [[Estonian Reform Party|Reform Party]] 18, the People&apos;s Party Moderates (election cartel between Moderates and People&apos;s Party) 17, Coalition Party 7, Country People&apos;s Party (now [[People&apos;s Union of Estonia|People&apos;s Union]]) 7, United People&apos;s Party&apos;s electoral cartel 6 seats. Pro Patria Union, the Reform Party, and the Moderates formed a government with [[Mart Laar]] as prime minister whereas the Centre Party with the Coalition Party, People&apos;s Union, United People&apos;s Party, and Members of Parliament who were not members of factions formed the opposition in the [[Riigikogu]].

The Moderates joined with the People&apos;s Party on 27 November 1999, forming the People&apos;s Party Moderates.

In fall 2001 [[Arnold Rüütel]] became the President of the Republic of Estonia. In January 2002 [[Mart Laar|Prime Minister Laar]] stepped down and [[Arnold Rüütel|President Rüütel]] appointed [[Siim Kallas]] the new prime minister. On January 28, 2002 the new government was formed from a coalition with The Reform Party and the [[Estonian Centre Party|Centre Party]]. 

Following [[Estonian parliamentary election, 2003|parliamentary elections]] in 2003, the seats were allocated as follows: Centre 28, [[Union for the Republic - Res Publica|Res Publica]] 28, the Reform Party 19, the People&apos;s Union 13, the Pro Patria Union 7 and the Moderates 6 seats. The United People&apos;s Party failed to meet the 5% threshold. Res Publica, the Reform Party and the Peoples Union formed the government. From this coalition President Rüütel chose the leader of the Res Publica party, [[Juhan Parts]], to form a government.

On 14 September 2003, following negotiations that began in 1998, the citizens of Estonia were asked in a referendum whether or not they wished to join the [[European Union]]. With 64% of the electorate turning out the referendum passed with a 66.83% margin in favor, 33.17% against. Accession to the EU took place on [[1 May]] of the following year. 

In February 2004 the People&apos;s Party Moderates renamed themselves as [[Sotsiaaldemokraatlik Erakond|Social Democratic Party of Estonia]].

On the  8 May 2004, a defection of several Centre Party members to form a new party, the Social Liberal Party, over a row concerning the Centrists&apos; &quot;no&quot; stance to joining the European Union changed the allocation of the seats in Riigikogu. Social-liberals had 8 seats, but a hope to form a new party disappeared by the 10 May 2005, because most members in the social-liberal group joined other parties. 

On [[24 March]] Prime Minister [[Juhan Parts]] announced his resignation following a vote of [[no confidence]] in the Riigikogu against [[Estonian Minister of Justice|Minister of Justice]] [[Ken-Marti Vaher]], which was held on the [[21 March]]. Result: 54 pro (Social Democrats, Social Liberals, People&apos;s Union, Pro Patria Union and Reform Party) without no against or neutral MPs. 32 MPs (Res Publica and Centre Party) did not take part.

On 4 April 2005, President Rüütel nominated Reform party leader [[Andrus Ansip]] as Prime Minister designate by and asked him to form a new government, the 8th in 12 years. Ansip formed a government out of a coalition of his Reform Party with the People’s Union and the Centre Party. Approval by the Riigikogu, which by law must decide within 14 days of his nomination, came on 12 April 2005. Ansip was backed by 53 out of 101 members of the Estonian parliament. Forty deputies voted against his candidature.

The general consensus in the Estonian media seems to be that the new cabinet, on the level of competence, is not necessarily an improvement over the old one. The new government is colloquially called the [[Andrus Ansip&apos;s cabinet|&quot;Garlic Coalition&quot;]], because the agreement between the party leaders was reached at the Tallinn restaurant , which specialises in garlic dishes.

On 18 May 2005, Estonia signed a border treaty with the Russian Federation in Moscow. The treaty was ratified by the Riigikogu on 20 June 2005. However, in the end of June the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed that it did not intend to become a party to the border treaty and did not consider itself bound by the circumstances concerning the object and the purposes of the treaty because Riigikogu had attached a preambula to the ratification act that referenced earlier documents that mentioned the Soviet occupation and the uninterrupted legal continuity of the Republic of Estonia during the Soviet period. The issue remains unsolved and is in focus of European level discussions.

[[Internet voting]] has already been used in local elections in Estonia, and the lawmakers in Estonia have authorized internet voting for parliamentary elections as well. .

On 4 April 2006, Fatherland Union and Res Publica decided to form a united right-conservative party. The two parties joining was approved on [[4 June]] by both parties in Pärnu. The joined party name is  Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit ([[Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica]]).

The [[President of Estonia]] is elected by [[Parliament of Estonia|Parliament]] (Riigikogu) for a five-year term; if he or she does not secure two-thirds of the votes after three rounds of balloting, then an electoral assembly (made up of Parliament plus members of local governments) elects the president, choosing between the two candidates with the largest percentage of votes.
The [[Prime Minister of Estonia]] ([[Estonian language|Estonian]]: Eesti Vabariigi Peaminister) is the [[head of government]] of the [[Republic of Estonia]]. The prime minister is chosen by the [[President of Estonia|President]] and conferred by Parliament. This is usually the leader of the largest party or coalition in the Parliament. 
The activity of the government is directed by the Prime Minister, who is the de facto political head of state. He does not head any specific ministry, but is, in accordance with the [[Constitution of Estonia|constitution]], the supervisor of the work of the government. The Prime Minister’s significance and role in the government and his relations with other ministries often depend on the position of the party led by the prime minister in vis-à-vis the coalition partners, and on how much influence the prime minister possesses within his own party. If the prime minister has a strong position within his party, and the government is made up solely of representatives of that party, he can enjoy considerable authority. In all crucial national questions, however, the final word rests with Riigikogu as the legislative power.

The [[Riigikogu|State Council]] (Riigikogu) has 101 members, elected for a four year term by [[proportional representation]].

The supreme [[judiciary]] court is the National Court or Riigikohus, with 19 justices whose chairman is appointed by the parliament for life on nomination by the president.

Estonia numbers 15 main administrative subdivisions. Due to the geographical and demographic size of these subdivisions, they are to be considered counties rather than states (Estonian: pl. maakonnad; sg. - maakond). 

Estonia is member of the [[Bank for International Settlements|BIS]], [[Council of the Baltic Sea States|CBSS]], [[Council of Europe|CE]], [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council|EAPC]], [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|EBRD]], [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|ECE]], [[European Union|EU]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], [[International Criminal Court|ICC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|IFRCS]], [[International Hydrographic Organization|IHO]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]], [[Interpol]], [[IOC]], [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] (observer), [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] (correspondent), [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], [[International Trade Union Confederation|ITUC]], [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]], [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons|OPCW]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], [[United Nations|UN]], [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina|UNMIBH]], [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]], [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|UNTSO]], [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]], [[World Customs Organization|WCO]], [[Western European Union|WEU]] (associate partner), [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]
