The Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC), also known as 29 Palms, Twentynine Stumps, or simply the Stumps,  is the [[United States Marine Corps]]&apos; largest base. It is a [[census-designated place]] officially known as Twentynine Palms Base, California located adjacent to the city of [[Twentynine Palms, California|Twentynine Palms]] in southern [[San Bernardino County, California]]. As of the 2000 census, the base had a total population of 8,413. The zip code of the base is 92278.

&quot;To conduct relevant live-fire [[combined arms]] training, urban operations, and Joint/Coalition level integration training that promotes operational forces readiness as well as to provide the facilities, services, and support responsive to the needs of resident organizations, Marines, Sailors, and their families today and tomorrow.&quot;

On August 20, 1952, [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]] Base Headquarters issued Post Order 343 creating the Marine Corps Training Center, Twentynine Palms. Two years before, the nation had become embroiled in the [[Korean War]]. As the need for live-fire training grew along with the swelling ranks, it became obvious that more ranges were needed.  Pendleton&apos;s Marines looked northward, and happened upon the abandoned Condor Field, a [[World War II]] [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[military glider|glider]] base located in the vicinity of what is now mainside.

The base was redesignated on February 6, 1953 as Marine Corps Training Center, Twentynine Palms. By February 1, 1957, it grew to base status and was again redesignated as Marine Corps Base, Twentynine Palms, Calif.

Only 70 Marines comprised the detachment at the Center. Manned by Marines from Camp Pendleton, its primary mission was to prepare the new base for the arrival of permanent personnel. By mid-December, 1952, a fresh [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]], with assistance from the [[12th Marine Regiment (United States)|12th Marine Regiment]], conducted the first large-scale, live-fire field exercise aboard the new base. The exercise gave Marines a glimpse of the facility&apos;s potential and foreshadowed the large-scale [[combined arms]] exercises (CAXs) for which the base is now known.

In 1976, under the command of Brigadier General Ernest R. Reid, Jr., work began to add an [[expeditionary warfare|expeditionary]] airfield to the base&apos;s growing infrastructure. When the first [[C-5 Galaxy]] landed in August 1978, it was apparent that the air-ground capability of the base was complete. Following completion of the [[expeditionary airfield, its name was changed to Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Training Center on October 1, 1978, and changed yet once more to Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) on February 16, 1979.  It was also during this time that plans for the [[Combined Arms]] Exercises were conceived.  Supplanting an earlier exercise known as Desert Palm Tree, the new CAXs were remarkable in two respects: the practice of combined arms, and live-fire and movement during the exercises were unprecedented in scale. Just as noteworthy was the creation of a Tactical Exercise Control Center with the primary purpose of controlling, instructing and critiquing the exercises. In the words of base historian, Col. Verle E. Ludwig, USMC (Ret.), &quot;Twentynine Palms was to be a permanent &apos;combined-arms exercise college&apos; for all of the Marine Corps.&quot;

On Oct. 1, 2000, after 21 years as MCAGCC, the command was redesignated as Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command, Twentynine Palms, California. This redesignation accompanied a change in policy that placed MAGTF Training Command under the auspices of Training and Education Command, [[Headquarters Marine Corps]], [[Marine Corps Combat Development Command|MCCDC]], [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]], [[Virginia]]. This arrangement simplifies what was occasionally a complicated chain of command. The expeditionary airfield and surrounding [[wikt:spartan|spartan]] accommodations for visiting units was nicknamed &quot;Camp Wilson&quot;. 

The base is currently home to the largest military training area in the nation (and the largest US base in the world), and consequently, the largest training program. The program known as [[Mojave Viper]] has become the model of pre-[[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] deployment training.  The majority of units in the Marine Corps will undergo a month at Mojave Viper before deploying to [[Iraq War|Iraq]] or a mixed training venue using the [[Mountain Warfare Training Center]] for [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]. Live fire exercises, artillery, tank, and [[close air support]] training are used for training, in addition to the sprawling &quot;Combat Town,&quot; a  fabricated Middle Eastern village, complete with a [[mosque]], native role-players, an &quot;[[Improvised explosive device|IED]] Alley,&quot; and other immersive touches.

In August 2008, the Marine Corps submitted a land withdrawal application to the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) for approximately  contiguous to base as part of an ongoing study by the Marine Corps for possible base expansion, along with the establishment of corresponding special-use airspace, necessary to train a [[Marine Expeditionary Brigade]] at the Combat Center.

Twentynine Palms Base is located at , within the [[Morongo Basin]] and the [[High Desert (California)|High Desert]] region of the [[Mojave Desert]], in [[Southern California]]. 

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the base has a total area of 3.7 km² (1.4 [[square mile|mi²]]).  3.7 km² (1.4 mi²) of it is land and none of it is covered by water. Please note that this only applies to the main cantonment which includes the base housing; the entire installation is far larger, with 2,413.178 km² (931.733 sq mi) of surface area, all land. There was a resident population of 14,090 on this territory as of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]].

The terrain is consistent with steeply-sloped mountains and flat valleys running northwest-southeast, with elevations ranging from 1,800 to  above [[sea level]]. The training area is also characterized with ancient [[lava flow]]s, as well as [[dry lake]] beds and [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyo]]s (or [[wadi]]s) that fill quickly during rain, presenting the danger of powerful [[flood]]s and [[washout]]s that can move [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armored vehicle]]s. Many [[abandoned mine]]s dot the terrain, as well as [[unexploded ordnance]] and [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]], making unauthorized travel in the training areas dangerous.

The climate is described best as [[arid]] and [[Upland (geology)|upland]] [[desert]]. Summer temperatures can peak at 120° ([[Fahrenheit|F]]) and bottom at 15° in the winter, with an annual average of 67°. Precipitation averages to four inches (102 mm)  annually, most often in the fall and winter months. Weather is generally clear and sunny days, with low humidity.

A futuristic version of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center is featured at the start of the movie [[Doom (film)]].

When the hit TV show [[Home Improvement]] was about to be sold into syndication, the producers decided to kick off the syndicated run with a brand new episode not shown on prime time. Much of that episode was taped in 1995 aboard the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms. The episode, titled &quot;[[List of Home Improvement episodes#Season 5: 1995-1996|Tanks for the Memories]],&quot; featured [[Tim Taylor (character)|Tim]] and [[Jill Taylor|Jill]] racing tanks across the desert base.

Twentynine Palms has a reputation within the Marine Corps for its relative desolation and isolation, due to the harsh desert climate and the remote nature of the base. The city of [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], while  away via [[California State Route 62]], is a popular destination, as well as the nearby [[Joshua Tree National Park]].  While many servicemembers consider the base to be a very undesirable post, giving rise to the nickname &quot;29 Stumps&quot; and an almost [[Popular culture|pop culture]] phenomenon about the installation&apos;s exaggerated [[:wikt:desolation|desolation]], others have thrived in the desert.

As of the [[census]] of 2000, there are 8,413 people, 912 households, and 904 families residing on the base. The [[population density]] is 2,287.5/km² (5,935.8/mi²).
