Pueblo () is a [[Colorado municipalities#Home Rule Municipality|Home Rule Municipality]] that is the [[county seat]] and the most populous city of [[Pueblo County, Colorado|Pueblo County]], [[Colorado]], [[United States]].  The population was estimated to be 104,951 in [[2008]], making it the [[List of United States cities by population|245th most populous city]] in the [[United States]].  

Pueblo is situated at the confluence of the [[Arkansas River]] and [[Fountain Creek]]  [[south]] of the [[Colorado State Capitol]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]. The area is considered to be semi-arid with approximately  of precipitation annually; however with its location in the &quot;[[banana belt]],&quot; Pueblo tends to get less snow than the other major cities in Colorado. Pueblo is the heart of the [[Pueblo Metropolitan Statistical Area]] and an important part of the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]]. Pueblo is one of the largest steel-producing cities in the United States; because of this Pueblo is referred to as the &quot;[[Steel City]].&quot; Many consider Pueblo to be the economic hub of south eastern Colorado. Due to this some people call Pueblo &quot;Colorado&apos;s second city&quot; even though Pueblo is the state&apos;s ninth most populous city. It is now home to a number of electronics and aviation companies. The [[Historic Arkansas River Project]] (HARP) is a beautiful river walk that graces the historic Union Avenue district. It shows the history of the Pueblo Flood.

It is the hometown of [[Damon Runyon]], who never returned after 1911 or so, but mentioned Pueblo in many of his newspaper columns (notably his &quot;Our Old Man&quot; pieces). Pueblo is also the home of [[Dutch Clark]], the first man from Colorado in the NFL hall of fame. Pueblo&apos;s largest football stadium is named after him. At this stadium is where the oldest high school rivalry west of the Mississippi takes place, [[The Bell Game]], which is played by The Pueblo Central Wildcats and the Pueblo Centennial Bulldogs.

Pueblo is the hometown of four [[Medal of Honor]] recipients - [[Drew D. Dix]], [[Raymond G. Murphy]], [[William J. Crawford]], and [[Carl L. Sitter]]. President Dwight D. Eisenhower upon presenting Raymond G. &quot;Jerry&quot; Murphy with his Medal in 1953 commented, &quot;What is it... something in the water out there in Pueblo? All you guys turn out to be heroes!&quot;. In 1993, The City Council adopted the tagline &quot;Home of Heroes&quot; because it can claim more recipients per capita than any other city in the United States. On July 1, 1993, the Congressional Record recognized Pueblo as the &quot;Home of Heroes&quot; (http://www.pueblo.org/homeofheroes/. There is a memorial to the recipients of the medal at the Pueblo Convention Center. Central High School is known as the &quot;School of Heroes&quot;, as it is the alma mater of two recipients, Sitter and Crawford, more than any other high school in the country.

Pueblo is the home to Colorado&apos;s largest single event, the Colorado State Fair, held annually in the late summer, and the largest parade, the state fair parade, as well as an annual Chili Festival.

The [[National Street Rod Association]]&apos;s Rocky Mountain Street Rod Nationals have been held in Pueblo for 23 years, and this is the region&apos;s largest and premier street rod event.

Pueblo&apos;s newest event is the Wild West Fest sponsored by the Professional Bull Riders. It will be held in Pueblo during the spring and the main event will be a PBR rodeo held at the state fair events center and shown all over the world. Also, Pueblo is home to the PBR team finals held at the state fair events center during the Colorado state fair and shown all over the world. In 2008 the PBR moved their corporate headquarters to Pueblo.

The highways [[U.S. Highway 50 (Colorado)|U.S. Highway 50]] and [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|Interstate 25]] cross each other at Pueblo, possibly making it the second most important intersection in the state, after I-70 and I-25 in Denver. The local airport, [[Pueblo Memorial Airport]], lies to the east of the city. It is home to the  (named for Fred Weisbrod, late city manager), reflecting the airport&apos;s beginnings as an Army Air Corps base in 1943. Pueblo Transit provides bus service six days a week throughout the city. Due to the growth of the Pueblo Metro Area they are considering forming a regional transportation district so they can serve some of Pueblo&apos;s fastest growing suburbs.

Pueblo may be best known as the home of the [[Federal Citizen Information Center]], operated by the [[General Services Administration]], and its Consumer Information Catalog. For over 35 years, [[public service announcement]]s have invited Americans to write for information at &quot;Pueblo, Colorado, 81009&quot; (though the official address is Post Office Box 100). In recent times GSA has incorporated Pueblo into FCIC&apos;s [[toll-free telephone number]] (1-888-8 PUEBLO) and web address (). 

The Pueblo city council is in the process of annexing over  north of Pueblo, owned by a Las Vegas development company, to be called the Pueblo Springs Ranch. This development has the potential of being one of the largest planned communities in the country, and will nearly double Pueblo&apos;s land area. According to the Pueblo Chieftain, the development will include residential area as well as a major tech park.

Pueblo is becoming the region&apos;s renewable energy capital. Vestas just announced that it would build the largest plant in the world which manufactures the towers for wind turbines at Pueblo&apos;s industrial park at close to 700,000 square feet. Also, a number of scientific studies now list Pueblo as the state&apos;s best place for solar energy and a good place for solar companies locate. Because of this a number of solar companies are looking to move to Pueblo at the old Pueblo Army Depot, one such company possibly the largest in the world. 

 

George Simpson, among other traders and trappers such as Mathew Kinkead, claimed to have helped construct the plaza that became known as El Pueblo or Fort Pueblo around 1842. George married Juana Maria Suaso and lived there for a year or two before moving; however, Simpson had no legal title to the land. The adobe structures were built with the intention of settlement and trade next to the Arkansas River, which then formed the U.S./Mexico border. About a dozen families lived there, trading with Native American tribes for hides, skins, livestock, as well as (later) cultivated plants, and liquor. Evidence of this trade, as well as other utilitarian goods, such as Native American pottery shards were found at the recently excavated site. According to accounts of residents who traded at the plaza (including that of George Simpson), the fort was raided sometime between December 23 and December 25, 1854, by Native American [[Utes|Ute Tribe]] and Jacarilla [[Apache]] tribes. They allegedly killed between fifteen and nineteen men, one woman, and captured two children. The trading post was abandoned after the raid, but it became important again between 1858 and 1859 during the [[Colorado Gold Rush of 1859]].

The current city of Pueblo represents the consolidation of four towns: Pueblo (incorporated 1870), South Pueblo (incorporated 1873), Central Pueblo (incorporated 1882), and Bessemer (incorporated 1886). Pueblo, South Pueblo, and Central Pueblo legally consolidated as the City of Pueblo between March 9 and April 6, 1886. Bessemer joined Pueblo in 1894.

The consolidated city was once a major economic and social center of Colorado, and was home to important early Colorado families the Thatchers, Ormans and Adams. Until a series of major floods culminated in the Great Flood of 1921, Pueblo was considered the &apos;Saddle-Making capital of the World&apos;. Roughly one-third of Pueblo&apos;s downtown businesses were lost in this flood, along with a substantial number of buildings. Pueblo has long struggled to come to grips with this loss, and has only recently begun a resurgence in growth.

The economic situation of Pueblo was further exacerbated by the decline of American steel in the 1970s and 1980s, and Pueblo still actively seeks to diversify its economic base. The City features a river walk, extensive trail system, industrial park, and revitalized downtown area to this effect.

[[Image:CF&amp;I Remains of A-Furnace.jpg|right|thumb|left|The foundation, stoves, and powerhouse of A-Furnace]]The main industry in Pueblo for most of its history was the [[Colorado Fuel and Iron]] (CF&amp;I) steel mill on the south side of town. The steel-market crash of 1982 lead to the decline of the company. After going through several bankruptcies, the company was acquired by [[Oregon Steel Mills, Inc.|Oregon Steel Mills]] and recently changed its name to Rocky Mountain Steel Mills. Since the acquisition, the company has been plagued with labor problems, mostly due to accusations of unfair labor practices. The problems culminated with a major strike in 1997, leading to most of the workforce being replaced.

Of the many production and fabrication mills which once existed on the site, only the steel production (electric furnaces, used for scrap recycling), rail, rod, bar, and seamless tube mills are still in operation. The wire mill was sold in the late 1990s to Davis Wire, which still produces products such as fence and nails under the CF&amp;I brand name.

The facility operated blast furnaces until 1982, when the bottom fell out of the steel market. The main blast furnace structures were torn down in 1989, but due to asbestos content, many of the adjacent stoves still remain. The stoves and foundations for some of the furnaces can be easily seen from Interstate 25, which runs parallel to the plant&apos;s west boundary.

Several of the administration buildings, including the main office building, dispensary, and tunnel gatehouse were purchased in 2003 by the Bessemer Historical Society. They are currently undergoing renovation. In addition to housing the historic CF&amp;I Archives, the first phase of the project has been turned into the Steelworks Museum of Industry and Culture.

President [[Woodrow Wilson]], on a speaking tour to gather support for the entry of the United States into the [[League of Nations]], collapsed on September 25, 1919 following a speech in Pueblo. He suffered a stroke a week later which incapacitated him for the rest of his presidency.

[[Theodore Roosevelt]] arrived at the Pueblo Union Depot in order to lay the first brick down for the Y.M.C.A., and also check the water resources in Colorado.

President [[George H. W. Bush]] (when he was Vice President) visited the Pueblo Nature Center&apos;s Raptor Center to release an American Bald Eagle that had its wings healed.

Other national leaders to visit Pueblo include President [[John F. Kennedy]], President [[Bill Clinton]], Senator [[John Kerry]], and Vice President [[Al Gore]].

In the 2008 presidential campaign, both major party candidates, [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]], visited Pueblo as part of their campaign. Colorado was considered a key [[swing state]] in that election, with Obama becoming the first Democratic candidate in 16 years to win the state.

Historically the other major employer in Pueblo was the State Hospital, which formerly served the entire state. Established in 1879 as the Colorado State Insane Asylum it was known as the Colorado State Hospital after 1917. In 1991, the name was changed to the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo (CMHIP). Currently under construction is the new Forensic Medium and Maximum Security Center, a 200 bed, state-of-the-art high security facility.

Pueblo is home to [[Colorado State University-Pueblo]] (CSU-Pueblo), a regional comprehensive university. CSU-Pueblo was formerly the University of Southern Colorado. It is part of the Colorado State University System, with about 6,000 students. On May 8, 2007, CSU-Pueblo got approval from the Board of Governors of the Colorado State University System to bring back football as a member of the [[Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference]]. The first game was played in the fall of 2008 at the Thunderbowl, a new stadium at CSU-Pueblo which holds over 12,000 people.

Pueblo Community College (PCC) is a two-year, public, comprehensive community college, one of thirteen community colleges within the [[Colorado Community College System]] (CCCS). It operates three campuses serving a widely dispersed eight-county region in Southern Colorado. The main campus is located in Pueblo and serves Pueblo County. The Fremont Campus is located approximately  west of Pueblo in Canon City and serves Fremont and Custer Counties. The Southwest Campus,  southwest of Pueblo, serves Montezuma, Dolores, La Plata, San Juan, and Archuleta counties. PCC is a Hispanic Serving Institution as designated by the Federal Government.

Centennial was rebuilt on a new site to the northwest in 1973.  [[Central High School (Pueblo, Colorado)|Pueblo Central HS]] was founded in Bessemer in 1882. Central&apos;s present campus on E. [[James Bradley Orman|Orman]] Ave. was built in the 1920s and expanded in the early 1970s. Its original building still stands four blocks away on E. [[Frederick Walker Pitkin|Pitkin]] Ave. Pueblo South HS and Pueblo East HS were built in the late 1950s to accommodate the [[Baby Boomers]]. Pueblo County HS, east of the city in Vineland, serves rural residents.  [[Rye, Colorado|Rye]] HS is in a foothills town southwest of Pueblo. Pueblo West HS is the newest, in the northwestern suburb of [[Pueblo West, Colorado|Pueblo West]]. The former Pueblo Catholic HS became [[Pope John XXIII|Roncalli]] Middle School in the early 1970s.
