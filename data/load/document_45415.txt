Bethel is a [[New England town|town]] in [[Oxford County, Maine|Oxford County]], [[Maine]], [[United States]]. The population was 2,411 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. It includes the villages of West Bethel and South Bethel. The town is home to [[Gould Academy]], a private [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]], and is near the [[Sunday River (Maine)|Sunday River]] [[ski resort]].  

An [[Abenaki]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] village was once located on the north side of the [[Androscoggin River]], but had been abandoned before its subsequent [[English people|English]] settlement. In 1769, the township was granted as Sudbury-Canada by the [[Massachusetts General Court]] to Josiah Richardson of [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]], [[Massachusetts]] and others (or their heirs) for  services at the [[Battle of Quebec (1690)|Battle of Quebec]] in 1690. It was first settled in 1774 when Nathaniel Segar of [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], [[Massachusetts]] started clearing the land. 

The [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], however, delayed many grantees from taking up their claims. Only 10 families resided at Sudbury-Canada when it was [[plundering|plundered]] on [[August 3]], [[1781]] during the last Indian attack in Maine. Two inhabitants, Benjamin Clark and Nathaniel Segar, were abducted and held captive in [[Quebec]] until the war&apos;s conclusion, after which the community grew rapidly. On [[June 10]], [[1796]], Sudbury-Canada Plantation was incorporated as [[Bethel]], the name taken from the [[Book of Genesis]] and meaning &quot;House of God.&quot;  

In 1802, a trade road (now [[Maine State Route 26|Route 26]]) was completed from [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] to [[Errol, New Hampshire|Errol]], [[New Hampshire]], passing through Bethel and bringing growth. More settlers and businesses arrived. Crops were planted on fertile intervales and [[meadow]]s formerly cultivated by Indians. Bethel became one of the best [[farming]] towns in the state, especially for [[hay]] and [[potato]]es. In winter, farmers found work [[logging]], with the [[lumber]] cut at [[sawmill]]s operated by [[water power]] from streams. Other manufacturers produced [[flour]], [[leather]] and [[harness]]es, [[furniture]], [[boot]]s and [[shoe]]s, [[carriage]]s, and [[marble]] and [[granite]] work. The Bethel House, a large hotel, was built in 1833.

On [[March 10]], [[1851]], the [[Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad]] opened to Bethel, carrying [[freight]] and summer tourists eager to escape the noise, heat and pollution of cities. Between the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[World War I]], Bethel was a fashionable summer resort. Several hotels were built facing the common or on Bethel Hill. Begun in 1863, The Prospect Hotel was the largest, with a [[cupola]] from which guests could observe the mountains. [[Tally-ho]] [[coach (carriage)|coaches]] provided tours through [[wilderness]] landscapes of the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] and Maine. Dr. John G. Gehring&apos;s famed clinic for [[nervous disorder]]s attracted many wealthy patients. Between 1897 and 1926, important figures in the music world performed at the Maine Music Festivals organized by William Rogers Chapman. But with the advent of the [[automobile]], tourists were no longer restricted by the limits of train service, but were free to explore. Consequently, many big hotels built near the tracks lost patrons, declined and were eventually torn down. The Prospect Hotel was largely destroyed by fire in 1911. The [[National Training Laboratories]] was established at Bethel by [[psychologist]] [[Kurt Lewin]] in 1947, but its headquarters moved to [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Virginia]] in 2005. Nevertheless, the town remains popular with tourists for its beautiful natural setting and historic charm.
