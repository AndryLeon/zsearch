Éowyn is a [[fictional character]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]&apos;s [[legendarium]], who appears in his most famous work, [[The Lord of the Rings]]. She is a noblewoman of [[Rohan]] who describes herself as a &quot;[[shieldmaiden]].&quot;

In [[The Lord of the Rings]] Éowyn, a daughter of the [[House of Eorl]] and the niece of King [[Théoden]], is introduced in [[Meduseld]], the king&apos;s hall at [[Edoras]]. She was the daughter of [[Théodwyn]] (sister to Théoden) and [[Éomund]], and the sister of [[Éomer]]. When she was only three years old, her father was killed fighting [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] and her mother died of grief. Éowyn and Éomer were raised in her uncle&apos;s household as if they were his own children. 

Tolkien writes she fell into depression since she longed to win renown in battle - more so because she was noble - but being female, her duties were reckoned to be at Edoras. When Théoden&apos;s mind was poisoned by his adviser [[Gríma Wormtongue]], Éowyn was obliged to care for her uncle, and his deterioration pained her deeply. To make matters worse, she was stalked by Gríma. 

However, when Gandalf (along with [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]]) arrived, he healed Théoden from Wormtongue&apos;s corruption, and Éowyn became infatuated with [[Aragorn]]. It soon became clear that Aragorn could not return her love (though he did not mention his betrothal to [[Arwen]]), and would not allow her to join him in going to war. As Aragorn pointed out,  The Witch-king further boasted that &quot;[n]o living man may hinder me,&quot; Éowyn then removed her helmet and declared: 

&quot;But no living man am I! You look upon a woman. Éowyn I am, Éomund’s daughter. You stand between me and my lord and kin. Begone, if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him.&quot;

After the demise of [[Sauron]], the happily wedded couple settled in [[Ithilien]], of which Faramir was made the ruling Prince by King Elessar (the name with which Aragorn ascended the throne of the Reunited Kingdom). Faramir and Éowyn had at least one son (likely Elboron), and their grandson was [[Barahir (Fourth Age)|Barahir]], who wrote [[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]] in the [[Fourth Age]].  Tolkien nowhere gives the cause and date of Éowyn&apos;s death, but one can presume she died of natural causes, in peacetime.

Éowyn is described to be very beautiful; she was tall, slim, pale, and graceful, with long golden hair and grey eyes.  In temperament she was idealistic, spirited, brave, high-minded, and lonely.

In the [[Old English language]] (the language Tolkien used to represent [[Rohirric]]) the word eoh (or eh) means &quot;war-horse, charger&quot; while wyn means &quot;delight, pleasure&quot; (in addition, some sample text within Bosworth and Toller translates wyn as &quot;joy, joyous&quot;). Therefore, even though no such word appears in the lexicon of Old English, the name Éowyn can be taken to mean &quot;delightful charger&quot;.

The meaning of Éowyn is often given as &quot;horse lover&quot; or &quot;friend of horses&quot; with the reasoning that eoh means &quot;horse&quot; and wyn translates as &quot;joy&quot;; however, Bosworth and Toller does not support this. In fact, the Old English word for &quot;horse&quot; is hors. For his purposes however, Tolkien used eoh to represent &quot;horse&quot;.

The first syllable of Éowyn sounds like &quot;eh-ah,&quot; with the &quot;ah&quot; just barely pronounced. As in [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]] or [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the y in the second syllable is the same sound as the German letter ü or the French u. The actors in the [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|Lord of the Rings film trilogy]] consistently pronounce her name as well as the names of [[Éomer]] and [[Théoden]] in a manner inconsistent with most reconstructions of [[Old English language|Old English]] pronunciation.

Tolkien maintained Éowyn was not the character&apos;s actual name. Her real name in [[Rohirric]] is not given, but it, as well as [[Éomer]] and [[Éomund]], would have started with the element Lô- or Loh-, meaning &quot;horse&quot;, which he represented with Old English Eoh-.

At one point Tolkien described Éowyn as &quot;a stern [[Amazons|Amazon]] woman&quot;. (Here he alludes to Éowyn&apos;s statement to Aragorn: &quot;But am I not of the House of Eorl, a shieldmaiden and not a dry-nurse?&quot;)

The voice of Éowyn was provided by [[Nellie Bellflower]] in the 1980 [[Rankin/Bass]] animated version of [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]], and by Elin Jenkins in [[BBC Radio]]&apos;s 1981 [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|serialisation]].

Éowyn also appears briefly in [[Ralph Bakshi]]&apos;s 1978 adaptation but does not have any dialogue.

In [[Peter Jackson]]&apos;s films [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)|The Two Towers]] ([[2002 in film|2002]]) and [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film)|The Return of the King]] ([[2003 in film|2003]]), Éowyn is played by [[Miranda Otto]]. (The role was first offered to [[Alison Doody]], who turned it down because of her pregnancy; [[Uma Thurman]] was slated for the role at one point.) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/trivia

She was apparently promised to Gríma by [[Saruman]] in payment for being the wizard&apos;s spy in the royal court (as in the book). She sang the [[dirge]] at [[Théodred]]&apos;s funeral. In the extended edition of The Two Towers, Éowyn is shown discovering, to her astonishment, that Aragorn is a long-lived [[Dúnedain|Dúnadan]]. 

In the original theatrical release of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Éowyn&apos;s injuries after fighting the Witch-king were less severe than in the novel: she is conscious but hurt, as opposed to unconscious. She plays a much larger role in the Battle of Pelennor Fields than in the book, where the only fighting mentioned is her conflict with the Witch-King.  She also replaces Merry as the person to sit with Théoden as he dies.  In scenes added in the Extended Edition of the film, she was near death:  her brother found her and screamed in anguish because he feared that she was dead. She is later seen being healed by Aragorn, and meeting Faramir in the houses of Healing.

While she did disguise herself in the film to ride into battle, she never took on the name &quot;Dernhelm,&quot; and the audience is always aware of her true identity. In the extended version, Théoden noticed her carving through the enemy but it is not clear if he realised that it is his niece. The production team stated that while in a book it was easy to disguise Éowyn&apos;s identity, in the medium of cinema the audience could visually tell that it was she, and it would have strained the credibility of the scenes to try to make it a secret and would have made Merry look foolish.
